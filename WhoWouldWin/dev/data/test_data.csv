"argumenta sobre: A Starcraft-sized force of Astartes Space Marines Versus a Warhammer-sized force of Terran Space Marines The maximum supply limit in a single game of Starcraft is 200, while your average Space Marine chapter is, to my understanding, at least 1000 marines. All the marines are the standard version, no specialists and no support units, and any elite heroes are right out. Each side starts on an open field... let's say a mile away from each other. With this and the respective strength and equipment of each type of marine, who takes these rounds? Round 1: Just the plain numbers, just the plain marines. Round 2: Each side can augment their ranks by replacing some of their marines with their support units and specialist infantry. What combinations could bring each side the win? Round 3: Now they have access to their side's respective ground vehicles. Who takes it then? Something tells me this is still a wash in favor of the Warhammer ones but who knows?

"argumenta sobre: Thanos is about to snap when a sudden anomaly comes in that not everyone even Dr strange knows about, they take the gauntlet, and begin making a mad dash for the tower PEPSI MAAAAAAAAAN!!!! Pepsi Man must make a mad dash for the Wakanda tower, with Thanos chasing after him, Thor being utterly dumbfounded, and everyone seeing this dude in latex sprinting across the battlefield with exactly what they need, everyone begins the chase after Pepsi Man. Round 1. Only Thanos Chases after Pepsi Man, while having to deal with all the bad luck Pepsi Man deals with in his game. No one can interrupt this chase for the ages. Round 2. Thanos and all his army are now chasing him, but now being slowed down by any heroes on the field. Round 3. Both heroes and villains are now all chasing after Pepsi Man. Pepsi Man now has his theme playing throughout the mad dash for the field, making him twice as strong.

"argumenta sobre: Ironman MCU vs. All of his previous villains. Ironman is how he was in Infinity War. The villains are Iron MongurIM 1, WhiplashIM 2 and Killian IM 3 The villains have a 2 hours of prep and will meet Tony in the setting of the final fight in Ironman 2. This is a 3v1. All villains have their fully upgraded, EoM suits if they wore one. The villains have as much knowledge of Stark's current suit as a very informed bystander would have in the MCU. I think this would be a stomp for Tony, but I'm curious if I am correct. Bonus Round: Infinity War Spider-Man takes each of them on individually. How does he do?","I don't think its that much of a stomp. Killian was pretty strong, and even alone could shred most of iron mans suits. And Iron man hasn't shown anything that could have done more damage than detonating an arc reactor, because theoretically the self destruction which failed to kill killian took all of the arc reactors power whereas any individual weapon blast only takes some of that power. I might be wrong about this one. Additionally, the nanotech suit in Infinity War was kind of just his safety suit right? It wasn't really his strongest combat suit, and even though it had a lot of new technology. I think that Killian can still 1v1 him in that suit, especially with help from the other two, although I figure they are kind of useless anyway."
"argumenta sobre: Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball Super are Banned. This has been a long time coming. The mod team has had a serious discussion about Dragon Ball and its place on the subreddit. This is something that has been brought up multiple times in the past and we've often hesitated on taking action on restricting series from , aside from things that are disruptive or don't promote healthy discussion e.g. memes, politics, etc.. However, time and time again this series has presented a constant problem that, frankly, we are tired of tolerating. With Super now over, there is little discussion left to be had on this matter and the potential of this series. From this day moving forward, we are no longer allowing any posts or comments involving or discussing Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Z Abridged, or Dragon Ball Super. This decision was made for the following reasons. Due to Reddit's recent crackdown on child pornography and anything close to it, we can no longer risk the safety of this subreddit given that Dragon Ball has a history of displaying a child's genitalia. With prominent characters such as Beerus and Whis, we cannot condone a pro-alcohol series and any attempts to justify this fall under violation of our ""no edgy stuff"" rule. Dragon Ball Z is pro-genocide, seen multiple times such as when Nappa wiped out the bug race. Portraying androids as created to perpetuate evil goals is disparaging to those with cybernetic implants, recipients of prosthetics, and the brave men and women who have lost limbs protecting America. Users mentioning characters or feats from any of the series listed above face temporary bans. Repeat offenders will be assigned ""shame flairs"" that will replace their current flair until such time that the mod team can continue to trust the user's ability to refrain from Dragon Ball posts.","I'm fine with you banning Dragon Ball, Dragon ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, but I'll be DAMNED if you take away Dragon Ball Z Abridged!

"argumenta sobre: 10 average sized twelve year old American boys vs 1 average American adult male. So, I got into it with some guys in askreddit and I just want to see what you guys have to say about this. I'm being 100% serious. Specs for our 12 year olds are going to be based off my google results for the average stats for that age, so it's looking like our 10 unsung heroes will be standing at 4'9 and weighing in at a whopping 88 lbs. Let's also say that our 12 year olds aren't necessarily cream of the crop ball players but that they all have experience being forced to play various sports throughout their younger years. No athletic freak future nfl anomalies among them, but they're all decently familiar with physical exertion and there aren't any McLovins out there just waiting to get murked. Since we're talking averages here, let's say none of them have physically fought anyone at this point in their lives, so no real fighting experience. But, assume they've all seen every avengers film, they each have an older brother that's forced them to watch Dragonball Z cell and frieza sagas, and they each saw the second Rush Hour on Tbs when they were children and went through a brief period of pretending they were kung fu practioners as a result. For our beloved average joe I'm gonna take the literal average American male. This means our fearsome apex predator is going to stand 5'9 inches tall and his weight will round out at 196 lbs. At the time of the altercation Joe will be 36 years of age, and despite repeated assurances from his wife that she still finds him attractive, for the past 7 years he's found no success in his desperate attempts to decrease the circumference of his 40 inch waist. According to Joe, he peaked athletically at age 23 after having played intramural soccer for several years while pursuing his bachelors in Business Administration. He also lifted weights in college off and on but was largely inconsistent outside of a few disciplined and motivated 3 month stretches. Although admittedly sporadic, when Joe did weightlift he was always sure to steal his roommates well reviewed protein powder, and would often resort to using the cheap walmart brand powder to replace what had been taken. He was never caught. Sadly, Joe's white collar desk job and soul crushing commute have left him largely sedentary for the past 10 years. Over this time period Joe's physical fitness accomplishments have consisted of signing up for the local annual 5k and subsequently failing to attend, as well as his consistent yearly gym appearances immediately following increasingly desperate, regretful, and overconfident New Year's resolutions. R1: The fight will occur in a gladiator style arena with our combatants starting opposite of one another. Everyone involved is wearing standard athletic gear gym shorts, jogging shoes, t shirt. This is a fight to the death and everyone present is aware of this. The 12 year olds are not necessarily blood lusted but they are committed to the fight and will only stop if incapacitated. All I mean by this is that even though they can't be scared into running away and abandoning the fight by maiming one of them in front of the others, they're still normal 12 year olds and won't be attacking like World War Z zombies with complete wreckless abandon and disregard of their own safety. But like I said, the kids are 100% down for the cause and fully understand the life or death stakes. Neither side is given prep, the situation is revealed just before the fight begins. Who wins R1? Is it a close fight or a curb stomp? R2: Joe is given 4 weeks to prepare mentally and physically for the battle. He is informed that he will fight 10 twelve year olds to the death and is given a photo of the venue but everything else in the prompt remains the same. The children will still enter the arena with no idea of what's to come. Does this change the outcome? R3: The Rock has decided to volunteer as tribute in place of our sweet Average Joe. He is not aware of any info about the fight and will be 100% clueless until the fight begins. The 12 year olds however are given 8 weeks to prepare for the battle but cannot receive outside strategic counseling from anyone other than one of the 10 that will fight. They will know that The Rock is their opponent and they'll be allowed to practice in the arena before the battle. Nothing else changes. Can they smell what The Rock is cooking and live to share the tale with their children's children?",You know the prologue scene to Fellowship of the Ring when Sauron shows up with that bat and just wails away 10 dudes at a time? It would be like that
"argumenta sobre: Agent 47 is Contracted to kill Homelander. He is given a method to execute and a certain amount of prep time. Who wins? I've always played around with the prospect of this potential match-up, but so it isn't so much one sided in either favor, I've elected to set up three scenario's of varying prep time and arsenal. Scenario 1 : Agent 47 is contracted by an anonymous and in this case irrelevant benefactor to assassinate Sister Sage. Having anticipated this, Sister Sage hastily constructs a bargaining chip in the form of a syringe to administer a de-powering serum of similar caliber to Butchers, but with the addition of piercing through any super durable flesh. Either after killing or in exchange for co-operation with Sage, 47 is given the syringe, and is given only a maximum of 5-15 minutes Depending on if they are in the same general location of Homelander or within accessible distance until her death is discovered, or she tips off Homelander, and he goes on the heavy offense. 47 Victory\- Administer the de-powering serum and assassinate Homelander by any other means. Homelander Victory\- Kill Agent 47 without disrupting public image. Scenario 2 : ICA Is contacted shortly after Homelander's deputization and contracted to perform an assassination. They are able to construct a similar piercing device as Sister Sage to be administered by dart or injection, however by the time they pick a date of a press conference at Vought HQ, Approximately 28 days post deputization, word has reached Vought of a possible assassination attempt, but have not acquired a who. At risk of total public meltdown, and ensuing premature? anarchy, Homelander is convinced by the rest of The Seven not to immediately blast any stranger on sight until probable cause can be found. This gives Agent 47 an entry point, but nothing more, as well as a possible weak link for an alternative threat in the ICA as a whole. 47 Victory\- Administer the de-powering serum and assassinate Homelander by any other means. Make a clean enough getaway without exposing the ICA to the greater ""Supes"" public eye. Homelander Victory\- Kill Agent 47 without disrupting public image. Compromise / Kill relevant ICA associations that would otherwise invalidate or disrupt the initial assassination plan before 47 can retaliate proper. Scenario 3: ICA Is contracted by an incarcerated Stan Edgar upon his dismissal from Vought to intercept and kill Homelander on behalf of concerned Vought scientists on the lower level, In order to prevent a ""Wisdom of the Ages"" level purging of their top scientists. In that time frame Longer than scenario 2, but less than one year, ICA is given access to databases relevant to their government allegiances, as well as some lower level Vought intel. They are also given time to psychoanalyze and observe Homelander's modus oparandi, to pinpoint a specific moment and location to conduct the take-down. In this scenario, Agent 47 Is armed with EITHER; The Aforementioned Piercing injector, which can also infect fluids or foods. The Aforementioned dart that can be administered discretely by launcher or manual toss ideally at mid range or high altitude to gain speed, or A single hardballer clip's worth of zinc alloy ""Screw threaded"" Hollow point bullets that allow a delayed injection beyond the upper skin level, but can not be silenced. Vought is not aware of the assassination attempt, unless the location conducted is under their existing tenure IE Vought Tower, shortly after 47's unauthorized arrival. While this gives the best chance of success, it hinges on finding a vital location and correctly getting in position to swiftly dispose of Homelander before retaliation, and depending on the location, Homelander also has less inclination to hold back under public scrutiny. 47 Victory\- Administer the de-powering serum and Kill Homelander by any means. Make a clean enough getaway without exposing the ICA to the greater ""Supes"" public eye. Homelander Victory\- Kill Agent 47 by any means necessary. So, the best of ICA vs the best of Vought. Who do you think comes out on top and why? I may share my potential takes if traction has it, but I want to keep my own thoughts and possible biases to myself in favor of others.","homelander senses him and lazers him from far away, he can also smell and hear him even if he goes very slow"

NO NUKES in this war and no stopping until the other side surrenders AFTER fighting, gets their land taken over, or otherwise incapacitated. The current leaders will stay current leaders for the duration of the war. If this swings to US, China and Russias favor: all other countries get notice of the alliance and get 1-2 weeks to prepare.","The outcome depends entirely on what you would consider a ""win"". American technology and logistical capability combined with Chinese industrial output means that this Alliance will curb-stomp in any conventional great power style conflict. The Alliance also automatically has nearly complete control over global trade due to the Sino-American navy being utterly unchallenged in any ocean. This is a serious problem, especially for the EU which is heavily dependent on foreign oil imports. What this boils down to is that the Alliance would destroy the world's conventional militaries within a matter of years but be unable occupy and govern their ""conquered"" territory effectively. However, a more realistic scenario imo is that the Alliance uses its massive economic leverage to exert de facto control over other world governments without direct conflict, while eviscerating any nations that fail to fall in line with its military might, and using its naval power to prevent other nations from assisting."

"argumenta sobre: Imperium of Man 40k vs Militaries of Unified Earth 2021. I dragged Earth back by some four years because there are too many conflicts nowadays, so I want to make it at least partially realistic. Technology shouldn't be changed that much. Basically, the Imperium of Man discovers Earth in 2021, and the God-Emperor of Mankind decides that he wants to add Earth into the Imperium. He will do anything to conquer Earth that doesn't include destroying the planet. Everybody on Earth gets informed of this and begins to assemble their forces. All will fight, from the American, Russian, Chinese, British, and French Militaries to a North Dakotan named Joe who owns a Remington 870. How long does Earth last against the Imperium of Man?","OP, how do you think we can win this scenario?"

As the title states, the only science education they receive is from binge watching their respective shows. Who would score the highest on their test?","I recently took the SAT August. However I have not watched either of those shows. But the SAT science test relies very little on actual science knowledge/facts you could study. Instead, it is almost entirely interpretation of data in the context of an experiment. The only question based on outside knowledge that I can remember from my SAT relied on knowing that organisms with high metabolic rates use energy faster, or something like that. Which even then could almost be inferred from the language. Not sure which of those shows would be more helpful for that. But that's just some perspective."

If a modern popular MMA or Boxing promotion decided to have a open weight class division. Which sport would be more likely to maintain a open weight division?,"Boxing.

Both sides have unending ammunition and supplies and the global navy at the time is all consolidated together prior to the battle. Can the combined naval forces of the late 1700s win? R1: almost no warning the global navy has just enough time to consolidate their forces before the Bismarck attacks. They start 10km apart. R2: The global navy gets 10 years warning of the impending attack including a photo of the Bismarck but no information on the internal components of the ship.,"Naval forces underwent one of the most dramatic Revolutions in Military Affairs in all world history when, in the 1860s, France and England both developed the ""ironclad"" concept. To say the Ironclad made every naval vessel before it obsolete may be an understatement. The ironclad was such fertile ground for rapid technological improvement that a new ironclad built in 1865 would ITSELF become obsolete by a newer ironclad built in 1870. Not ineffective. Not second-rate. Obsolete. In 5 years. This process of uncontrolled advancement continued until the Dreadnaughts appear at the turn of the century, at which point things slowed from a frantic pace to a rapid pace. Three more decades after that the Bismarck left the drydock. The only thing that would stop this hypothetical Bismarck from ruling the entire world in the 1700s would be that it can only be in one place at a time."
argumenta sobre: Mike Tyson Vs Muhammad Ali Both are facing on in a boxing match. Both Tyson and Ali are in their prime. They aren't trying to kill each other but they will do everything to win. Bonus: the winner gets to fight Rocky Balboa around Rocky 3/4,"I always thought that if they both fought each other ""blind,"" that Ali would win. But if you put prime Ali in a Time Machine and had him travel to prime Tyson's era and fought right off the bat, Tyson would win. People forget how much a student of ""the game"" that Tyson is. He constantly watched footage of the greats when he lived with Cus. I'd imagine he studied Ali's every move. He lived, breathed and ate pun intended boxing. Ali would not have that kind of scouting luxury. He never fought a fighter like Tyson."

The four Yautja have followed the trail of bodies until they encouter the gang properly while they're hiding out at Horseshoe Overlook the first camp following the game's prologue. The reason for picking the first camp is because the gang aside from Micha Bell are a united front at this point in the story and haven't fractured yet. Dutch hasn't lost his marbles yet either and has Hosea to keep his more reckless tendencies in check. Arthur isn't sick yet so he's at his strongest also. The entire gang are at their strongest.

But there really wasn't anyone else besides the insufferable Horatio Gates considered by the Continental Congress. Washington spent most of his time during the war being outmaneuvered and outfought by mediocre British generals. His greatest military accomplishments were: The retreat from Brooklyn Heights only necessary because he bungled the siege of New York The Battle of Trenton hardly a traditional battle, but one for which he deserves full credit The Battle of Yorktown and the campaign leading up to it, which were largely driven by French commanders and siegecraft. There were two things he did that nobody else could have, or would have done: Held together a starving, freezing, unpaid, poorly equipped army in the faced of the world's greatest military power by sheer force of will and courageous example At the height of his power and popularity, he handed in his commission to civilian authorities and stepped down from his army post, when with a word he could have been king of the new nation. That being said, Grant actually had military training and had worked his way up from being a junior officer to division commander, to overall command of Union forces.

No one is able to manipulate time or any other broken hax. 1 Billion people with be given flight, superstrength and heat vision 1 Billion people will be given superspeed 1 Billion people will be given telekineses But 100 tons is the maximum amount they can lift 1 Billion people will be given elemental powers like the abilities to control or manipulate the fundamental forces of nature, such as fire, water, earth, air, and lightning. 1 Billion people will have superhuman strength 3 Billion people will be given the MCU version of the mark 85 iron man suit They know how to use it too R1: Humans with no prep time R2: Humans with 1 week of prep time before the invasion","The approach that the superpowers are relevant is a very... comic-like thought pattern of epic battles of alien invaders vs. superheroes. A type 2 civilisation has a completely different scale of possibilities. A nice example is the Droplet in the ""Three Body Problem""... and the Trisolarans aren't even a real type 2 civilisation. The moment a Type 2 civilisation wants to conquer Earth, all the superpowered humans look up to the sky and last thing they see is the brief flicker of a gamma-ray burst. After that the earth is sterilised."

"argumenta sobre: Tiger VS Human This post is mainly to settle an argument between me and a buddy. Some background information: My buddy is a power lifter, about 6'4, 225 pounds of pure muscle. Can deadlift about 605 pounds, squat about 500, and bench press about 365. He insists that in the scenario of a fully grown tiger charging after him, he could kill it. His technique is to put his arm up, let the tiger bite his forearm then gouge its eyes. He does admit that he would probably lose his arm, but in the end he would win. I insisted that the tiger would easily obliterate him in one swift move but he still strongly believes that he would come out victorious so it's time to settle the argument.",This reminds me of that Man vs Elephant post.

"argumenta sobre: In an alternate universe, all of the MCU villains won. Can the Dark Avengers stop Thanos? In this alternate universe, the villains beat the heroes except Hela and Dormammu because they're too OP and formed the Dark Avengers. At this point, they pretty much have complete control over earth's government and do as they please. Meanwhile, Thanos is off trying to collect the Infinity Stones to move forward with his plan. - The Power Stone is held by Yon-Rogg off planet. This is the first stone Thanos will go after. - Malekith, Laufey, and Loki amongst other Dark Elves are on a ship in possession of the Tesseract. - Kaecilius is in possession of the Time Stone and has the help of Abomination, Whiplash, Aldrich Killian, Justin Hammer, Iron Monger, Mysterio, and Vulture - The Collector has the Reality Stone, but Ego, Ronan, and Nebula are planning on stopping Thanos from getting it - The Mind Stone is inside of Ultron who is being protected by Ghost, Yellowjacket, and Killmonger in Wakanda - The Soul Stone is in the possession of Red Skull who is backed by Hydra, Winter Soldier, and Zemo","Thanos either clears the whole list or he loses at step one, depending on how dangerous Yon-Rogg is with the power stone if he's strong enough to wield it. If Thanos gets it from him, he clears. The biggest threat would be Ego, but with the power stone and the tesseract, I think Thanos has what it takes to get rid of him. Perhaps if the list included Hela somewhere, they'd have a better chance but overall, he either gets obliterated by the power stone, or he takes it and it's relatively smooth sailing from there due to the power stone's unlimited combat potential along with Thanos's own durability.

Groundhog day doesn't provide any concrete rules on how exactly the time loop breaks, but for fun, let's pin down a some simple ones. The loop breaks when the loopee bears no ill will or disrespect for anyone, genuine goodwill towards everyone, and is at total peace with their actions during the day. There's no cheating and ""pretending"" to be good to get out. You also don't get a freebie for just not being aware that your actions are insane, even if you personally think there's nothing wrong.

The only detriment to those two is their shared border as well as borde to Indonesia 283M and Pakistan 251M, who are 4th and 5th in population. If they all beat up on each other early on, that opens up the door for countries with better geography. I'd give China the edge just because India is sandwiched between China and Pakistan while China has a lot of coastline. I'm sure the average person from some countries are ""worth more"" than those from other countries, but not enough to make a major difference. USA would be a very long shot based not being in as congested of a continent."

"argumenta sobre: What is the least advanced technology that would have the biggest impact if delivered to Julius Caesar? One piece of technology, is delivered to Julius Caesar on the day he becomes emperor of Rome. It can be anything that has been invented as of 2024, but only one will be sent. If the item requires electricity, a small hand powered generator is sent with it. The generator may not necessarily be enough to power the device if it requires a lot of power however. What is the least advanced item that could provide the biggest impact on history? I think it would be something that is simple enough that Romans would understand it fairly quickly, but the concepts are something that humans won't discover for a long time. For example, a microscope would be understood as lenses already existed, but it would provide knowledge of micro-organisms that nobody would otherwise even conceive of for centuries. This revelation would launch medicine ahead far beyond what developed in history since people will figure out bacteria far sooner. Another one I had in mind is the telegraph, which would be fairly quickly understood as a means of transmitting a message through a wire. It's a simple concept, the only barrier is electricity.","A couple potato seeds. Not even GMO potatoes, just modern cultivars that benefit from centuries of selective breeding. Or even wilder, more ""natural"" variants if that'd count as less advanced. If potatoes can proliferate in the Old World 1550 years ahead of schedule it'll trigger a population boom and very quickly send world history way off course."

"argumenta sobre: All 5 of America's major sports leagues go to war; which one wins? America's 5 major sports leagues NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and MLS are going to war, each armed with all the gear and equipment they use in a given game balls, protective gear, bats, sticks, etc. The following battles all take place in a massive, perfectly flat field, with the armies in a circle 1000 feet away from each other. Round 1: Each league fights with however many players they have. Round 2: Each league is limited to just 100 players. Round 3: Same as round 2, except they're stripped of all equipment and have to fight hand to hand.","Interesting prompt. Hmm... Well the NBA and MLS both get completely slaughtered. They are quick, sure, and in great cardiovascular health, but they have virtually no combat relevant equipment. More importantly, they're too lean. Hockey and American Football players outclass them in size and strength by a \considerable\ margin, even if they weren't already using their gear. MLB fares decently well but cannot win. Bats and helmets are useful, and most players have mean swinging arms...but that's about it. Despite a baseline level of cardiovascular health, and very specifically developed swing and pitch related muscles a lot of pro baseball players are honestly pretty out of shape compared to their peers. They cannot run as far or oftentimes as fast, they carry a higher percentage of body fat considerably so, in some cases, and tend to be older; the sport is less physically taxing, and players often continue into their 40's while many NHL and NFL players call it quits as early as 30. It comes down to the NFL and NHL. If players are forced to wear and use all equipment, NHL obviously loses because it is very difficult to walk in ice skates. If its voluntary...I'd still give it to the NFL but only 6/10. They have excellent gear, applicable strategies, and massive, muscular frames. Many of them are on PEDs as well. They lack any melee weapons like the NHL, but they're so large, and so well practiced in tackling and pummeling opponents in an organized fashion that they can pull out a win more times than not without said weapons. More importantly, they have strong enough gear to weather a few bats and sticks to the face."
"argumenta sobre: How the heckCould Chris Hansen catch a Predator Chris Hansen's goal is to Catch a Predator, have it take a seat right over there, and ask it what it thought it would accomplish by coming here today. He is allowed to use any weapons or training he could realistically procure. There is a single Predator, the same one from the original movie, which Chris Hansen has seen","Predators don't attack unarmed people, so Chris can safely ask it his question. The hard part is baiting it to the house and getting it to take a seat. The best bait for predators is good prey, so he hires a bunch of truly desperate people to carry around weapons until they're attacked, then sprint back to the house while staying as alive as possible. They sprint into the house, then into a secure panic room so when the predator charges in Chris shuts the door behind him. The house will actually be a bunker made of very strong substances steel door, concrete walls etc so the predator can't just smash it's way out. That places Chris and the predator in the room alone. Chris is unarmed and therefore safe. Chris's best chance to get it to take a seat is to tell it he'll open the panic room so the predator can kill the bait-people if it sits down. He may need to use mime. I think the predator would sit down in exchange for a resumption of the hunt. Then Chris asks the question."

Decent chance, an average human isn't gonna crush Tigger's skull in one swing, but Arnold with a sledge? MAYBE, tigers have a pretty intense bone density, so Hobbes will definitely feel it, but it may not put him down. Honestly, a sledge is likely a bad weapon choice, he'd be better off with something of equal weight/ destructive capability but a smaller area of contact.

"argumenta sobre: Can a united 15th-century Europe produce a single modern ball-point pen? Was looking at my 50-cent ball-point pen and admiring how perfectly the machined steel ball fits into its tiny socket so here we go. All of 15th-century Europe is given the task of producing a single modern ball-point pen within 50 years or face annihilation by a magic force. The same magic force unites them, preventing all combat or conflict. They do not need to produce the same kind of ink. Can they do it? Round 1: They're given all the industry schematics for producing a ball-point pen but nothing else. Edit: Given how easily they can clear Round 1, I'm changing Round 2 from 1 pen to 1 million pens. Round 2: They're given all the industry knowledge, schematics, etc. for each step of the supply chain involved in producing a ball-point pen starting from raw materials. Meaning the materials and plans for all the machinery ever involved in the process. Basically, they have all the knowledge on how to build a 21st-century factory and its supply chains. However, they must produce 1 million pens in 50 years. Picked a million because from what I can google, the annual output of a small factory is in the millions of pens. They're a united continent with 50 years. Hopefully, it's fair. Bonus: If not, when is the earliest time a united Europe could accomplish it?","Absolutely. It's not even particularly hard. Like, they probably can't mass produce them, and it would absolutely be a hassle to use the damn thing because of the whole ink thing, but the only even moderately difficult part of the whole process is making a small metal sphere for the tip and you can do that with the shot tower method. Admittedly that method hadn't been invented yet during the prompt, but ball bearings existed at the time examples of them are in Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks so they clearly know how to make metal spheres. The only challenge is making them smaller. Once you've got the sphere all that's left is making a custom metal pen body and that's easy. --- Unless of course you're requiring it to be a modern disposable ballpoint pen, in which case it's impossible. They can't invent plastic in fifty years."
"argumenta sobre: 6 average men are given different weapons/buffs to 1v1 and kill a t-rex in a jungle, who has the highest chance of killing it? man A: has a musket used by British soldiers with 20 bullets man B: has a lightsaber man C: can stop time for 10 seconds1 minute cooldown man D: drives a military grade light armored carno mounted weapons man E: has 3 Molotov cocktails man F: has his body enlarged to 15 meters tall and his weight and physical power scale accordingly. He suffers from no biological issues in this scenario like in reality with science.","Probably F, sure T-Rex were big but like only 6 m tall, it probably scales the fight to roughly fighting a medium to large sized dog. Lightsaber is decent but edge him getting stepped on or hurting himself before he kills it. None of the other guys could reliably kill an elephant ."

"argumenta sobre: John Wick and Agent 47 are both contracted to assassinate Frank Castle 616. Who gets to him first and who succeeds? The High Table and the ICA have both put out a $15 million contract on Frank Castle AKA The Punisher, who's been killing every other operative they send his way. As a result both agencies decide to send their top assassins after him at the same time. Who's more likely to complete their mission? Each character has full access to their weaponry from the comics Punisher and the movies/video games Wick/47. - R1: Frank is unaware of either Wick or 47 being on his trail. - R2: Frank IS aware of both and has gathered some intel on them with Micro's help. - BONUS ROUND: Wick and 47 realize they're both after the same target and must kill the other in order to continue the mission. Who wins?","I'm pretty sure 47 takes every round. The only way Wick is really good at killing is in a direct confrontation. Sure, there was that one scene in the first film where he used a sniper rifle, but most of the time it's much more up close and personal. 47, on the other hand, gets much more creative with his kills. Poison, sabotage, and stealth are his bread and butter. Many of his assassinations are assumed to be freak accidents with how good he is- nobody knowing he was even there. Wick is a killer, while 47 is an assassin. Frank has a MUCH better chance of surviving R2, probably going off the grid. However, the ICA has access to live feed from satellites. Even if Punisher goes underground, a last known location goes a long way. He'd essentially have to be isolated in an underground bunker for as long as the contract is active. For the bonus round, 47 easily finds Wick before Wick finds him. Much greater stealth and a master of disguise, while Wick was able to be found by pretty much everyone that went looking for him. 47 knocks out Baba Yaga with a cupcake, steals his clothes, and snaps his neck."

Santa gives a copy of his Nice/Naughty list on USB Drive to each member of the Joint Chiefs. The list has names, locations, and behavioral status of all relevant children. Santa will destroy the USA if the job isn't completed to his satisfaction. He teleports around and ""Nothing Personal Kid""s a few people in and about the Pentagon so they know he's serious. All relevant parties have seen and acknowledged Santa's power. Can the US military complete the mission? US military can tell people what they're doing, but the rest of the world will react normally, as if Santa doesn't exist. US can use its Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Space Force, and Marine Corps. - Round 1: The US military must deliver presents to all Nice Christmas celebrating children on the planet. There are 363 days to prep. The gifts must be delivered on Christmas Eve. Presents must be within 100 feet of their target's home.

"argumenta sobre: Featured Characte Sign-Ups for July - September 2025 What is this? Every week our subreddit features a character,wikifeaturedcharacter and every two weeks we feature a team.wikifeaturedteam These posts are written by users for characters and teams they feel deserve more love on the subreddit. They serve as something like a shorter respect thread, with the goal of introducing people to the character or team in question. So if you go to one and say ""Doesn't this belong on ?"", expect to be mocked! For those who had no idea that this subreddit has Featured Characters, swipe right on the mobile front page, and be amazed. How to Sign Up This post will be for sign-ups for the July through September session and will stay up for around a week. Therefore, Sign-Ups close at 11:59 PM EST, Sunday, June 15th, give or take. Now, how do you sign up? Easy. Just post here, listing either the character or team you're planning. Then, at any point, before signups close, send us a Proof of Concept through modmail A Proof of Concept can be anything from a draft of the thread, to an already done Respect Thread, to an Imgur album of feats, so long as we know that you have something ready. If you don't have an acceptable draft ready within one week of your submission's scheduled date, we will choose a backup in its place. After everything is set, you can look forward to the Season Schedule a little later once we've finalized everything. What's a Featured Characte? How do I do these things? Easy! If you're familiar with the concept of , then you'll be able to understand this stuff. A Feature is basically a reasonably sized post summarizing the character or team, who they are and what they can do, including things like feats, allies, etc. etc. etc. in the case of teams, having small sections for each member of the team. Maybe throw in some recommended reading while you're at it. Need a helping hand on how to set up the formatting? Check out our template guidewikitemplate or just ask us for some tips. Feature Rules and Guidelines For a Featured Character post, we are looking for posts that have a reasonable, easily digestible number of feats. We're basically looking for briefer posts that get to the nitty-gritty of what a character can do rather than a full respect thread. Tell us who the character is, their most notable feats, and how they can be used on WWW. Team posts will have looser restrictions on this, but we're still looking for them to be easily consumable. Characters and Teams that have been featured in the past will not be accepted, excepting special circumstances such as being an alternate version of the character, or something. Characters or Teams that are in poor taste will not be considered. And we reserve the right to, for any reason, turn one down though we never really exercise this. We will prioritize submissions that have a Proof of Concept that is closer to completion and higher quality. What this means is we will put someone who has a final draft of their Proof of Concept earlier in the schedule than someone who has an incomplete draft or is just submitting a respect thread. If you want to increase your chances of making the cut, submit a final or nearly final draft of your Feature. Be aware that the team deciding this will have the final say in what is accepted and if we feel your submission is either incomplete or misleading of a character or team we reserve the right to refuse to put it on the schedule as a result. Don't complain if your Character or Team doesn't get picked. There's always next time. In addition to the rules, we have a few guidelines and/or suggestions for your submissions! Generally, we aim to show off more obscure characters, but that's not necessarily a prerequisite nor will someone 'popular' being submitted automatically veto a submission. Go for variety! Notice a lot of Marvel characters, or think more video game teams should be represented? Here's your chance to fix that! We want a lot of fun characters and teams to show off! Further, if you are submitting a draft for a character, if you use someone else's Respect Thread for your proposal, you must submit documentation that you obtained the permission of the Thread's author beforehand. We will be following up on this, and if your draft is wholly another person's RT, your submission will likely not be favorably viewed. Want some examples? Check out our Featured Archive or look at these example submissions, Tomura Shigaraki and Homelander for Featured Characters, and Ash's Champion Team or The New Avengers for Featured Teams, which are excellent displays of what we're looking for. If your submission includes NSFW material specifically nudity or other sexual material, please let the mod team know when you submit your proof of concept and mark the specific feats that are NSFW in your post. TL;DR Put effort into your draft. Bring something new to the table. Tell us if your post is NSFW. Backups In the event of someone not posting their feature on their scheduled date, the modteam will step in and supply an entry for that date. This is to encourage submissions to be of the highest possible quality as well as reward a quick response time. The following dates will be available to post your Features: Featured Characters July July 2 July 9 July 16 July 23 July 30 August August 6 August 13 August 20 August 27 September September 3 September 10 September 17 September 24 Featured Teams The number of team slots may vary depending on the number of submissions received. July July 5 July 19 August August 2 August 16 August 30 September September 13 September 27",I'd like to do a featured character for Marvin the Martian Looney Tunes or a Featured Team for the Stellaron Hunters Honkai: Star Rail. Preferrably later in the schedule for both if possible

"argumenta sobre: ""You cannot invade mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass."" - General Isoroku Yamamoto. How long could today's Texas hold off Imperial Japan? Imperial Japan is at the height of its pacific conquest. Texas cannot be helped by anyone and no one but the Imperials can exit or enter its borders. A category 5 hurricane is also approaching around where Galveston is, and stays over Texas for a maximum of about 3 weeks, hitting the coast at the start of the invasion at 650 miles in diameter. Only Texan civilians, as the military is government and therefore 3rd party intervention.","So, 6 million or so fanatic soldiers used to guerilla warfare and heavy vegetation march into Texas. They are brutally stalled at cities and towns by the high ratio of gun owning Texan Citizens, numbering 26 million overall, who have modern firearms and require no more than a few minutes prep; the Galveston-Centered Hurricane prevents Naval Bombardment, Texas National Guard is ready within two hours tops to provide Aerial Superiority and coordinated action as a standing army or battalion. Imperial Japan relied on two things: Having more troops, and having terrain advantage. They've already lost the tech advantage; and they certainly don't have either the numbers or the experience in a dry climate. EDIT: I'm assuming Japan is bloodlusted, and not retreating to recoup past the border for a years long hit and run strategy that would likely take decades, given you said Texas has no ICBMs."

"argumenta sobre: Most evil character that could lift Mjolnir? Being worthy of Mjolnir does not include being good natured, however, some of the qualities prevent most evil characters from lifting it. That being said, what is the most evil character that would be considered worthy of lifting Mjolnir?","So, the thing with Mjolnir is that it's not very clear what its standards are. We know Captain America can lift it but Superman ordinarily cannot. In JLA/Avengers Odin had to specifically disable to enchantment so Superman could use it in an emergency. So the conditions to look for are the qualities that distinguish Cap from Superman. It sounds like ""worthiness"" then probably has something to do with Norse values surrounding a warrior's spirit. Clark Kent is a farm boy at heart and really just wants to be a regular dude if given the choice. Steve Rogers meanwhile desperately wanted to fight in World War II in spite of his physical limits at the time. So whoever lifts it has to have some kind of soldier-like quality. But there's clearly a selfless element to it as well. Cap isn't a glory-seeker. He's not interested in fighting for himself. He just doesn't like bullies. It's not easy to find someone evil who is also a selfless warrior. You can find people who think that's what they are but those kind of people are straight up psycho. That's Claude Frollo ""I'm doing this for your own good"" shit. It'd have to be someone who does bad things but genuinely will fight on behalf of someone weaker when push comes to shove. So the names springing to mind are maybe Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn? There's also Ghaleon from Lunar who's the first game's main villain and by the second game checks all the boxes."

Amon Avatar: The Legend Of Korra Amon, the leader of the Equalist anti-bender revolutionary group, arrives in the magical land of Equestria to spread the influence of his goal to make benders and non-benders equals among each other after removing bending from the world. While traveling through the land, Amon takes notice of a small, mysterious village in the middle of nowhere, with ponies having strange, perpetual smiles on their faces, and equal signs on their flanks. Amon, curious about this strange place, walks towards the village to enter it, and comes across the village leader, the unicorn known as Starlight Glimmer, who takes notice of this stranger, and trots up to Amon and asks him what brings him to their home. Amon asks Starlight if she's the leader here, and Starlight says yes. Amon, sensing something wrong about Starlight, asks how exactly she was able to make these ponies in this town equal, and live in this ""utopia"", with Starlight saying that she used the ""Staff Of Sameness"" to rid everypony of their cutie-marks to spread equality across the land, and ensure that nopony will have to experience abandonment because of their special talents, and by removing them, true friendship will be preserved. Amon, not believing this, tells Starlight that she is removing everypony's individuality by getting rid of their special talents, and that she must be using her own form of bending to do so, and he's afraid that is something he can't allow to happen. Starlight, shocked that Amon has seen through her facade, angrily calls him out, telling him that she's saving these ponies from feeling abandoned by doing this, and if he's going to stand in the way of that, then she has no choice but to eliminate him. Amon laughs, telling Starlight that she's welcome to try, beginning the battle between the two equalists. The fight takes place in Our Town, Equestria at noon.

There's a pretty obvious path of him gathering intel, scrapping his way to a basic set of mandatorian or old trooper armor and going from there. I'm not a huge marvel fan or anything but this seems extremely doable. He can go stealth and blow up a shuttle with the emperor on it. He could use his intelligence/contract work to disrupt the emperor's hold.

"argumenta sobre: ""Zombie"" apocalypse but it's dogs and cats Instead of ppl turning into dumbass corpses, infected ppl turn into dogs and cats all different types, including animals like wolves and lions. The dogs and cats will not turn on each other like actual zombies. Dogs and cats will act like their animal self other than mindlessly pursuing humans. If a dog infects, victim turns into a canine and if a cat infects, they turn into a cat. Infection is via bite, scratch or excessive licking. Current dogs and cats will spread transmission and are now ""zombies"" but tbf, they won't spread transmission until 72 hours after initial attacks.

Ppl turn within 10 mins from bites or scratches, but excessive licking can take 24 hours provided the dog/cat saliva does enter the body and just stays on the skin. Does humanity survive? Bonus: humans that turn into cats and dogs still have their human brain/mindset. They can choose to side with humans by not ""infecting"" others. They can also now speak their native language. All current/wild dogs and cats will still be animals and try and turn humans. Edit: the cats and dogs are NOT zombies. They're normal cats and dogs. They act like their normal animal self. That's why licking is a way of transmission because a dog or cat can be affectionate that way","The animals all starve long before they completely saturate rural areas. Cities might be a different story, but all zombie apocalypses are like that."
"argumenta sobre: Strongest character who, if time-travelled to the beginning of their series, could NOT stop the plot from happening. As the title says, which character at the end of their series could not, if sent to the inciting incident before it ever occurred, would be completely unable to stop it from ever occurring. They have a full decade of time to plan, scheme, or do whatever they want to stop it. They are fully committed to averting whatever threat they dealt with in the original timeline. Despite this, which character would be completely unable to succeed?","This is pretty much the plot setup for Doraemon. The gist of it is that the series protagonist, Nobita Nobi, was such an incompetent loser that his great-grandchild goes ""let's send this futuristic robot cat with reality-warping gadgets back in time so his life ends up better"". Despite its title character having access to among many others instant light-year-distance travel, a phone box that can alter reality based on a ""what-if""-type question, an IRL delete button that can retcon any living thing, the ability to make voodoo dolls of anyone on the fly, and multiple methods of travelling to any point in time, none of this seems to have any effect on Nobita's life long-term. As an aside: I've been wanting to make a Respect thread for the character for the longest time, but it's proven to be a herculean task given the sheer scale of the franchise."

Don't believe me, throw a few at a brick wall, and watch them take huge chunks out of the thing. Same with barbells. Gyms typically have lighter barbells made of 10, 15, and 25 lbs on top of the standard 45 pounder. If you land just one or two hits with something like this against the bird, it's going to add up. Again, you could probably break bricks by beating them with these bars"

Well, that doesn't make for a very interesting fight, so in this battle we are going to assume Steve has a magic satchel that makes anything aside from what he is currently holding in his hands and wearing on his body weigh nothing. Hardcore mode is enabled so Steve can starve and won't respawn. Minecraft version is 1.13. Round One; Early Game Gear: -Iron Armor -Iron Sword -Iron Pick -Stone Axe -Stone Shovel -A Stack of Torches -Half Stack of Pork Chops -A Stack of Cobblestone Round Two; Mid Game Gear: -Diamond Armor -Diamond Sword -Diamond Pick -Iron Axe -Iron Shovel -Shield -Bow enchanted with Infinity + an arrow -A stack of Pork Chops -A stack of Torches -Two potions of your choice -A stack of Cobblestone -A bucket of lava and a bucket of water -A Horse with average stats OR a couple of Wolves Round Three; End Game Gear: Basically whatever can fit in your inventory that can be obtained without hacking. From Ender Pearls to Totems of undying. You can expand your inventory with ender chests and shulker boxes, but you must explain how Steve would access the items mid-battle without being killed. For example, if the opponent is tanky but slow, you could say Steve teleports 50 meters away with an ender pearl whenever he needs to restock Bonus Round: Steve cannot directly engage in combat with his enemy but instead must defeat them with some sort of contraption. He has 24 hours to build.","I never got people bragging about Steve's inventory feat. Lots of characters have very large amounts of inventory space.

"argumenta sobre: has been purchased and is now owned by The Walt Disney Company Exciting news everyone! We were recently made a proposal by Disney to acquire all rights within this subreddit. After a long discussion, the mod team has accepted the terms, and as of today we are now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, alongside other notable companies like Marvel Studios, The Jim Henson Company, Lucasfilm, and, recently, 21st Century Fox. With this acquisition does come some changes. Because this is now a Disney-licensed subreddit, we will only allow matchups involving at least one character from a property owned by Disney. Since 85% of all posts involve the MCU already, we don't expect this to be a big change. Furthermore, in accordance with maintaining a good public image and face of the company, we will also begin enforcing a stricter policy on content. The subreddit will now strictly be a PG environment, so we will no longer allow any language that you would only see in a PG-13 movie or higher, nor will we allow any references to any sexual or overtly violent actions. Finally, we would like to introduce a new head mod that will be overseeing these changes, and this one is excited. We have a change in the moderation team now.

Bonus round: Every time something is broken it spawns one new gorilla, what happens to the world?","For the first few months, the series of tragic deaths was simply a set of coincidences. The CEOs of Flex Seal, Loctite, and Scotch had their homes broken into and were terribly mauled by what appeared to be a wild animal, but oddly enough nothing was stolen. When the CEO of Weldwood went down, things started smelling sticky. Some of the top names in glue were murdered, and the international glue supporters were getting nervous. Who was next? Was this glue serial killer going to slay every producer of glue in the world? Horses everywhere felt a sense of hope for the first time in centuries. The new CEO of Scotch began investigating. What was the similarities between the killings? She began searching through their pasts, illegal dealings, financial rivals, anything that could give a clue to who had adhered themselves to this wicked gluesade. Eventually she came to a dead end and dropped the search. Two months later, the International Glue Convention found all of the CEOs of the glue world seated around a large table. Super Glue was heading the meeting, and began with a moment of silence for their fallen comrades. Scotch looked around the silent room, and noted that Gorilla Glue seemed to be missing. Oddly enough, they had been silent about the glue murders since the beginning. Once the meeting officially began, the CEOs began discussing whether or not the CEO of Michaels deserved to be there. Huntsman CEO was taking notes. He put a bit too much pressure on his pencil, a No. 3 graphite pencil. It snapped in half. What followed was a blur of motion. His head flew from his body and landed in front of the H.B Fuller CEO, who screamed in terror. The hulking beast began mauling and tearing at the weak, helpless humans, who could do naught but scream and flee. The new Scotch CEO was grabbed by Super Glue. ""Come quick I know an exit! Quickly!"" They dashed down the stairs, with roaring and grunting close behind them. ""I've been preparing for this."" Super Glue led her into a secret room behind his office, and sealed the massive iron door. ""This room is impenetrable. The walls and door are 8 inches of solid iron, and everything in here is virtually unbreakable. What came after us is Gorilla Glue, the same beast that slayed our friends and your predecessor. It goes after anything that is broken, and is intent on killing every last one of us."" ""I knew it had to be something like that, I should've assumed it was Gorilla Glue."" ""We'll be safe here. We can stay for up to three months with these rations."" And so the two lived like that. They were careful never to break a nail on a door jamb, never to break a container, never to rip or tear the bed sheets. Eventually, with no one else to turn to, they began to fall in love. They enjoyed each other's company, even though it was the only company they had, and actually became content with the life they had. Two months in, Super Glue made a confession. He had a wife and kids back home. ""How could you do this to me!? Am I just your affair? Is that why you locked us up in here? Super glue... ""You're breaking my heart."" The realization of what she said came to her eyes which filled with terror. The last thing either of them saw, was a pair of meaty, glue filled paws."

Click here for a list of already-posted submissions Click Here for Frequently Asked Questions The Character Scramble is a long-running writing prompt tournament in which participants submit characters from fiction to a specified tier and guideline. After the submission period ends, the submitted characters are ""scrambled"" and randomly distributed to each writer, forming their team for the season. Writers will then be entered into a single-elimination bracket, where they write a story that features their team fighting against their opponent's team. Victors are decided based on reader votes; in other words, if you want people to vote for you, write some good content. The winner by votes of each match-up moves on to the next round. The tournament continues until only one participant remains: the new Character Scramble champion! The Champion joins the GMs of the next season, is responsible for the theme and tier of the next season as well as all of the writing prompts, and they also get to choose a monthly banner theme for the subreddit as a reward. Come join our official Discord Channel! It's the most active community for Scramble by a HUGE margin, and is the first place to get new info as it comes out. You don't even have to participate in the chat to be a part of the fun, so just swing on by! Click here to join the email list. — Basic Rules & Scramble Process PLEASE NOTE: Signups will close at 11:59pm US Eastern Time on July 3rd, and Tribunal will go up the following morning. Anyone who isn't done when Tribunal goes up will have their incomplete submissions removed or will be DQed if they don't have enough submissions after removal. If you don't want to be rushing to finish, get your stuff done well before the deadline! If you want to compete, you must submit THREE 3 characters, one in each of the three listed Classes, that adhere to the rules listed in the Submission Rules section below. You may also optionally submit TWO 2 backup entrants, which must be of different classes and will also adhere to some rules. Specify at the top of the submission post if a character is a backup. If a main character submission is deemed out-of-tier in Tribunal, the submission will be replaced by an entry of your choice from the backup pool. While listing backups, feel free to list the other classes they might fall under for convenience, as in Tribunal, you'll be able to pull backups subbed to roles other than the one an OoT'd sub was placed into as long as they could feasibly fit into this role as well. Of course, still pick a role to sign them up as. Each character must be submitted in their own parent comment in this thread. Don't reply to your own submission comment with another submission; make a separate comment thread for each individual submission. After you complete your submission posts for all of your main submissions and any back-up submissions, fill out and submit the submission form linked at the very top of this post. If you need to make a change during sign-ups, just resubmit the submission form with the same name and new info. We'll use whichever version is newest. DO NOT resubmit this form after Tribunal; we'll account for any Tribunal changes to rosters on our end. After signups are done, we'll begin the Tribunal, which is a community-regulated period for users to point out characters they feel are over- or underpowered. Please keep an open mind when receiving criticism; it is encouraged for you to comment on the characters of other participants as well. Similarly, please be diplomatic as you go about these debates. Characters with issues that are not amicably resolved may be replaced by a back-up character at the discretion of the GMs and a panel of selected judges. If you would like to apply to be a Tribunal judge, please fill out this form. After Tribunal, the characters are scrambled so that every participant ends up with two submitted characters. You will then select a third, according to the rules below, to create a team with a sub of each Class: a Vanguard, an Infiltrator, and a Sentinel, each of which will be described in a later section. This season will include a Pick One rule like in Season 18, rather than a Keep One rule like in others. When subs are scrambled into teams, you will receive two characters of different classes. During Round 0, you will then choose your third team member from the pool of unscrambled characters in the class you haven't yet received. This pool is guaranteed to include your unscrambled sub in that class. So it's a good idea to submit high-quality characters that you'd enjoy writing about for weeks or even months—that way, you're guaranteed to have something you like in your Pick One pool! Participants also have the option to opt out of NSFW submissions and veto one submission out of the list of total submissions. You can't veto your own submissions. Links to a form for opt-out and veto will be provided after Tribunal ends and before the scrambling happens. You may not opt out of NSFW submissions if you have yourself submitted a character from NSFW media. Once everyone has their teams, the rounds will begin. Every round, a prompt is posted.

After results are posted, the brackets are updated and the next round begins. — Theme The theme of Scramble 20 is Mass Effect Since the release of its first game in 2007, the Mass Effect franchise has taken its place in history as one of the most critically acclaimed role-playing games and works of science fiction of all time. Tens of millions of players have stepped into the shoes of the daring and charismatic Commander Shepard and, in their quest to save the galaxy from fearsome foes that lurk in dark space, have fallen in love with the rich characters and storylines, as well as the deep and intricate way their choices matter and affect the overall experience. We hope we can capture some of that ""choices matter"" magic as we bring you a season of prompts which, while not following the events of any one game chronologically, will serve as something of a highlight reel, a greatest-hits tour of some of the series' most memorable moments. Submission Rules Participants will submit THREE 3 characters who fit the tier, each into one of three classes inspired by the Mass Effect games, explained more below. You get up to ONE 1 major change on each character submission submitted this season. Refer to the FAQ for more info. — Tiersetter & Details Scramble tiersetters are based on specially-curated Respect Threads, using a variety of sources for their feats. Submitted characters' feats will be compared to this RT, and any tiersetter feats not included in this RT will not apply for the purposes of tiering. Submissions for this season will be matched against Cloud Strife. This is a solid step upwards from last season, but not too far—and it's a tier we haven't done in a while, either, so we're super excited! Your submissions must score between a Likely and an Unlikely Victory against the tiersetter. For more information about what that means, check the FAQ. For tiering purposes, all matches will take place in Armax Arena Combatants will start at the center of the arena as depicted here Although in game the billboard in the center rotates, and you can see it in different positions in the album, for tiering purposes it will remain static in the position as it is in the starting distance image. Nobody else will be in the arena other than the combatants; if you see guys in there in the screenshots, that's just 's Shepard in Photo Mode shoutout to Free for getting the pictures btw. Beyond the tier, we are also bringing back submission roles in a way that hasn't been seen since Season 9, more than seven years ago. To celebrate Mass Effect's tactical gameplay and represent the wide range of extraordinary abilities Commander Shepard's squadmates bring to the table, you will be submitting characters into three Character Classes. These roles are modeled after three of the classes in the Mass Effect games, and each of your three main submissions are expected to align with a different one of the classes. The three classes are as follows: Vanguard: These fighters love nothing more than a flat out brawl. These are your classic bricks. They're the type to get in your face and just trade blows until only one is left standing. Submissions to this class should be primarily melee combatants. Infiltrator: These combatants are no less deadly than their melee counterparts, but they prefer to take down their target with something besides brute force. They are snipers, saboteurs, summoners, and more. They can scrap in melee if forced to, but those are absolutely not their ideal conditions. Submissions to this class should either be primarily ranged combatants, or they should fight their opponents in some other unorthodox manner. Sentinel: These combatants operate best when they have allies at their sides, bringing utility to the battlefield that their friends can benefit from. Whether they can heal their allies, shield people or objectives, create obstacles to hinder their enemies, or something else entirely, submissions to this class should bring something to the table beyond direct damage. However, they are still combatants; unlike previous roles like Manager and Spirit, this is not an exclusively supportive role. Sentinels should be combatants who can interact with the tier while still providing utility to their teammates. We will be vibe checking subs' suitability for these roles. This vibe check will be fairly permissive, especially for Sentinel, but we do want to make sure that we preserve the class flavor. Just because Dr. Strange is a Vanguard in Marvel Rivals doesn't mean he's one in Mass Effect. While these roles are primarily for flavor, we wanted to make it a little easier for subs fulfilling that flavor to be subbed. To do this, we've slightly expanded how we're going to be looking at Unlikely and Likely Victories this season, while keeping it relevant to the tiersetter: We will consider a Vanguard with up to high strength, high durability, and target speed to be a Likely Victory. We will consider an Infiltrator with up to target strength, high durability, and high speed to be a Likely Victory We will consider a Sentinel with at least low end in all three stats to be an Unlikely Victory. These slight expansions are only applicable to the class listed. Please note that you do not have to fit ONLY these profiles. A character that is cleanly within the tier anyway is still within the tier. This includes a Vanguard sub with high speed, an Infiltrator with high strength, a character that happens to have one OoT stat but works out to be in tier, et cetera. Such characters are, simply, not eligible for the above special rules but could be subbed normally as long as they're in tier. — Additional Rules & Guidelines Characters must be in tier. Characters must be researchable. The show, video game, movie, or other media from which your character originates must be accessible in some way, ideally online. Your character must have a functional Respect Thread, so that people can understand your character's stats and abilities at a glance. It is preferable that your character's Respect Thread is hosted on the Respect Threads subreddit but Characte of the Week posts or any real repository of cited feats are acceptable. We understand that many Respect Threads are still in a state of disrepair after the death of gfycat. That being said, you are still expected to show something for your character, it's not difficult to collect and reupload the important feats using the wayback machine for a mini-RT so please at least do that. We will NOT be extending the time to make your mini-RTs into Tribunal like we did a few seasons ago when Gfycat first perished. If your character does not have a Respect Thread of any kind, please at the minimum include a Mini-RT in the sign-up post with at least five combat-related feats that completely cover the character's stats and abilities. VSBattlesWiki pages or similar sources are not acceptable Respect Threads. You cannot submit characters that you have created, helped to create, or in any way developed. If the GMs believe you have asked someone else to submit a character you created, we might ban that as well. You cannot submit a character with feats based on a previous Scramble story. This rule prevents Scramble writers from tailoring characters to be submitted to future tiers. You may submit real life figures and celebrities, but not if they're notably controversial. No Trump or Biden, no Putin, no Kanye, none of that. The GMs reserve the right to decide what qualifies as ""controversial."" While you can submit characters from NSFW series with risqué material such as an ecchi anime, you cannot submit characters from actual pornography. Additionally, if your character is child-presenting and put into sexual situations, they will be immediately kicked out. If you are unsure whether a character falls into this category, be sure to notify a GM. Characters from High School DxD, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, No Game No Life, and Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA are banned from being submitted this season. Other Fate characters are allowed, though we will take them on a case by case basis. Characters from ongoing series remain at the balance level from when they were submitted. The GMs reserve the right to veto specific submissions under what we call the ""Dude, come on"" rule. This clause may sound extremely abusable, but honestly we'll only use it for submissions we feel violate the spirit of the above guidelines or are otherwise deemed unusable, like ""disaster movie lava"" or ""a swarm of bees with the consciousness of Steve Buscemi."" Not exactly rules, but some suggestions: Submit characters you actually want to write yourself. With this season's Pick One mechanic, trust us when we say you'll want to guarantee there's something you genuinely like in the pool. Ask yourself: Will your hilarious meme submission idea actually be hilarious over the course of an entire writing contest, or will the joke get old immediately? If you're only submitting a character because the act of submitting them is funny, don't submit them. If you don't have any ideas for submissions, it's recommended that you try submitting one of the many back-ups we're likely to have. Additionally, the GMs have created an official suggestion doc to give you a character you could submit or maybe just a point towards what kind of things you can submit. Sometimes people like different things, and that's okay. Don't hate on a submission or submitter just because you personally don't like the character or the series. And on the other end, you don't have to withdraw a submission just because someone else doesn't like them. You are allowed to make some changes to a character for the purpose of making sure they're in tier or otherwise clarifying what gear they have available. Within reason of course, see the FAQ for more info. In general, avoid submissions with changes that radically change the character, such as ""Ferris Bueller with Iron Man's armor"" or ""Goku with the stats of Captain America."" Duplicate submissions aren't prohibited, but try to avoid submitting the fifth Spider-Man submission this Scramble. Check to see if someone else has already submitted your character before you. The best rule of thumb is that if you really want to submit a character someone else already has, at least try to find a different version of them MCU Spider-Man as opposed to 616 Spider-Man. This allows more variety in character choice. Just make sure they fit the tier too! Listen to feedback. You don't have to follow it, but if a lot of people are saying the same thing, at least humor the idea that they might have a point. — System Changes To Note Class Roles: As detailed above, we are requiring submissions to match one of three classes inspired by the Mass Effect games. Your three main submissions must each belong to a different class, and if you submit backups, each backup must belong to a different class. These classes will have slightly different parameters in Tribunal, which can be found above. Pick One: As explained above, we're putting the classic Keep One mechanic away this time. Instead, everyone will have the opportunity to pick the third member of their team from a pool of characters made up of the Class they haven't received yet, and one character in that pool will be their own sub in case they want to pick it. Major Changes: Characters may be submitted with up to ONE 1 major change to help them better fit the tier. More information on what will be allowed for Major Changes this season can be found in the tier, and in the FAQ. Submission Forms & Prompts To submit a character, fill out the following form in a comment to this thread. Include either the writing or non-writing prompt. As long as all of the below information is included, you can add extra information or reformat your submission post however you want for maximum aesthetic. Of your three main submissions, two of them MUST use the writing prompt to count. If you are submitting backups, half of your submissions, rounded up, must have writing prompts. If you submit all 2 backups, this means you have to write three writing prompts. If you're not competing and only submitting back-ups, you may only submit 3 backups total. You still must use the writing prompt for at least two of them, and each must belong to a different class. This is your chance to win over people who otherwise wouldn't know what to replace their main sub with, so put your best foot forward and try to submit things people might enjoy writing about! Submission Template > Name: The character's name. > Series: The name of the piece of media your character is from. You can add specifications as necessary. > Class Role: Vanguard, Infiltrator, or Sentinel? If this is a backup, feel free to list the other classes they might fall under for convenience, as in Tribunal, you'll be able to pull backups subbed to roles other than the one an OoT'd sub was placed into as long as they could feasibly fit into this role as well. > Content Warning: Simply state if this character's series has anything people may be uncomfortable seeing. Nudity, heavy gore, extremely graphic imagery, just mark it here. If this doesn't apply to your character, simply leave this field blank. > Biography: A quick summary of your character. Who are they? What can they do? Where are they from? What are they like? It doesn't need to be a novel, but a good paragraph of information is appreciated. > Research: A link to your RT or RT-substitute, as well as any other links that might help someone understand your character quickly. You may also suggest how much of the series someone needs to read/watch to get a good idea of the character. Make sure it's understandable though; a newcomer won't know what My Hero Academia's ""Deku Contracts Malaria"" arc is. > Justification: Briefly outline why you think your character is in tier, and where in the tier they fall Unlikely Victory, Draw, or Likely Victory—See the FAQ for more information. The non-writing prompt already covers some of this information, but to expedite the Tribunal process, at least give a sentence or two. You can write something as simple as ""Strength similar, low dura but high speed,"" or really get into the nitty gritty if you wish. > Motivation: Everybody fights for something, what about them? Is it love? Vengeance? Money? The thrill of the fight itself? Tell us about it here. > Major Changes: Check the FAQ for what to put here. You only get one! > Minor Changes: Check the FAQ for what to put here. You get as many of these as you need, but try not to go overboard. Writing Prompt It's a big galaxy out there, and whether for work or for play, your character has ended up on a new and unknown planet… or, at least, one they've never been on themselves. Before they can get their bearings, though, two things catch their eye: A scowl and a giant chunk of steel. The man says that this is just business, contract work for some guy neither of you have ever met—but last you checked, mercenaries didn't usually run around with swords that big. Either way, one thing is clear: You're not getting out of this without a fight. Prompt Rules Not Trained, but Chosen: You are writing a battle between your character and Cloud Strife, where, no matter how hurt they are, they'll come out alive. Even if your character has only a small chance of victory against their opponent, write that small chance happening! I Will Destroy You!: You must defeat Cloud in a direct physical confrontation. He's a pretty standoffish guy anyway, so maybe he deserves a good punch to the face. Although the prompt is reasonably open, you must write a fight, and you must write your character winning. If you are doing a writeup for a Sentinel class, you may instead write about how your character assists someone notably weaker than Cloud to defeat him instead. Keep in mind, however, that Sentinels still fight themselves. The Lazarus Project: Cloud doesn't have to be Cloud. You can substitute his appearance in your signup for anything or anyone you like. Whatever you pick as the opponent will be assumed to be an equally strong stand-in. Galaxy Map: The default location of the fight for tiersetting purposes is Armax Arena, as stated above. However, you may set your writeup wherever you want. Go crazy. After all; nobody's doing any voting yet. Non-Writing Prompt > Analysis Versus Cloud Strife: Go deeper into how your character fares against the benchmark. How their abilities match the tier, how their stats counteract each other, specific instances that are likely to happen in a fight between them, and so on. Because this analysis serves as a replacement for a narrative, you need to communicate how your character fights for instance, whether they rush in headlong or approach tactically and exploit weaknesses and what that means for them fighting other characters. > Biggest Strength and Weakness: Discuss the best thing your character brings to the table in a fight a tactical mind, unorthodox abilities, good stats, et cetera, and also what detriments or drawbacks they might have a specific stat that's lower than the others, lack of ranged options, inability to work with others, et cetera. > Character in Setting/with Team: Your character is going to be thrown into a large group setting. How will they function in that kind of thing? Are they a leader type? A lone wolf? Will they try and betray their allies? Or will they just hang out, do as they're told, and hope their side wins? Explore how they fit into a group dynamic here. > Paragon or Renegade: We've each got choices to make on our journey. Your sub is no different. Is your character more the Boy Scout type who wants to accomplish their goals ""the right way?"" Or are they the maverick who will do whatever needs to be done to kick the bad guy's ass and get the mission done?","Character Submissions List This is a list of all the characters who are being submitted at the moment. I update this list as soon as I can. An X next to a submission signifies that the writing prompt for that character is complete. An X next to a username signifies that all their writeups, including backup writeups, are complete. Characters are not backups unless clarified otherwise. If someone has all their main submissions completed but does not have the X next to their name, they are still in the Scramble, but the uncompleted backups don't count for now.

"argumenta sobre: The Mythbuster's Jamie Hyneman Throughout the Mythbusters run, Adam Savage makes constant references to Jamie's past as if he is some sort of mythical immortal being. According to Adam's claims Jamie: Was raised by wolves. Had a career yak herding in Nepal. Is over 300 years old. Invented duct tape. Fought in the Crimean war. Was a Russian circus performer. Literally built the pyramids. Is part robot. Doesn't sleep, merely waits. Can talk to animals. Has a black belt in a form of martial arts that does not exist. Built a flame thrower at 4 years old. Speaks at least 14 languages with 0 training. Doesn't die, instead turns into a pile of berets. Assuming Adam's claims are literally true, who is the strongest fictional character he could reasonably defeat?",There's not much here that relates to combat capabilities. Presumably his long lifespan and robot physiology translate to enhanced durability. And he has combat experience from crimea and black belt skills in a made up form of martial arts. The rest is mostly irrelevant. I'm gonna put him in the middle tier of street level. He can probably get some wins against Punisher level guys normal humans with good gear and training but he's not touching Captain America.

I can justify both wins, but I want to hear general thoughts","Rashek could for very brief instances contend with The Emperor physically. Just comparing him to the Primarchs whom he massively outclasses even still, The Emperor is thousands of times stronger and faster than a normal human. Even with compounding Rashek is bottlenecked by the size of metalminds he's carrying on him. He'd have to tap enough to make himself orders of magnitude stronger and faster just to keep up at all, which he can likely only do for a few seconds. Rashes also just has no real answer to The Emperor's Psychic and Perpetual nature. The Emperor can basically completely annihilate Rashek's soul bypassing his Compounded Feruchemical Healing, meanwhile Rashek even if we say he has enough metalminds on him to temporarily physically surpass the Emperor, can not harm him in any way that matters due to the Emperor being an immortal perpetual and an extremely powerful Biomancer. He'll just heal from anything Rashek does assuming he can do anything at all. I could go on for ages as the Cosmere and 40k are probably my two biggest passions but Tl/DR the Emperor stomps and it's really not close even if you're maximally generous to Rashek."

Apart from his insane forensic investigating skills Phoenix wins every case he takes for one reason; he believes in his clients. He's not necessarily an amazing lawyer in terms of flat out defense, his real skill is finding the truth. He'll drag every detail to light regardless of how it appears to impact his client, because he knows beyond a shadow of doubt that they're innocent.

Round 3: The Illuminate 10x the number invading Commorragh against the Dark Eldar Fight till surrender or destruction of one side Random encounter","I will answer this question indirectly, by comparing one of the enemies of both of these factions; humans. In the Helldiververse, the Illuminate Have been beaten by Super Earth in the past, and even know, while they are mounting an attack on Super Earth itself, they seem to be having a rough time of it. So I think for now we can call them AT LEAST equals to Super Earth... for now. However, the weapons, soldiers, and tech of Super Earth? Doesn't even come close to being able to stand against what the Imperium of Man has laying around casually. Given that the tech we see in 40K for the IoM is actually a downgrade from their golden years of tech, they still have some of the most batshit insane stuff around. In an all out fight of equal numbers, the IoM beats Super Earth, and it's not even close. And that ignoring the millions if not BILLIONS if not vastly more worlds in their control that have soldiers, psykers, mechs, etc. And we see that in terms of combat ability, the Eldar can at least hold their own in a fight against the IoM. Maybe not as good as they'd hoped, but that's kinda how this whole thing works, most factions are of roughly equal combat prowess until there's a canon winner. So based on what we see, with both the Illuminate and Eldar beings shown to be roughly equals to their verse's humans, given we see 40K humans win HARD against SUper Earth, we can therefore conclude that Eldar would win the conflict, as well."

The movies are with their respective real life actors - Satan's Alley: unironic drama about medieval homosexuals, starring RDJ and Tobey - Scorcher: average action movie starring Ben Stiller - Scorchers 2-6: average action movie sequels starring Ben Stiller - The Fatties: A ""comedy"" starring Jack Black and more Jack Blacks - Simple Jack: unironic drama about the life of an autistic boy starring Ben Stiller R1: Which makes the most and least money in the box office R2: Which gets the highest and lowest rating from critics R3: Can any of them win an oscar","Scorcher for sure. Mindless action will always do well, whereas none of the others would. Satan's Alley is 20 years too late. People don't throw money at projects like that anymore, if anything they are actively avoided. The Fatties is a comedy and an especially un-PC one. It makes zero money because it doesn't get released. People will make sure of it. Simple Jack fails for the same reason as Satan's Alley. People are largely just over that kind of content. Although that one is just an attempt of oscar bait that wouldn't have made money even if people weren't over it."
"argumenta sobre: Which member of the Fellowship of the Ring could bench press the most? LOTR How physically strong do you think the members of the Fellowship of the Ring are? Would general elf superiority make Legolas able to lift the most? Is dwarf strength greater than a powerful human like Boromir? Can Gandalf use any of his power to lift things with muscle? If you had to rank the Fellowship of the Ring in terms of only pure raw strength, what order would they be in? The contest is bench press. Assume they all know how to do it. Gandalf is limited to his grey form and Eru isn't interested in getting involved. Everyone else is at peak. I was thinking books, but movies are fine too. - Bonus: What generally humanoid Third Age character could bench press the most? No giants or trolls or things of that nature.",Gimli can probably bench press Legolas bench pressing his limit. Aragorn can get close but can't beat raw Dwarven power
"argumenta sobre: The Cops who arrested Thanos vs the Muggers who mugged Darkseid Pretty self explanatory. The muggers have just mugged someone and are spotted by the police, and a fight ensues. Who would come out on top?","I was thinking about this fight. Thanos is kind of in between above Herald and but below Skyfather Level characters and Darkseid is at least Skyfather levels of power. So while the cops who arrested Thanos are probably in the Skyfather tier of power people like Odin and Zeus, the guys who mugged Darkseid are at the very least Galactus or Celestial Level in terms of power and those guys are above Skyfathers. The guys who mugged Darkseid wins"

They'd probably be able to hurt him, if they manage to make a good enough plan, but the gap is just way too big. If you used the Legends versions of everyone who exists in both, however, that'd be a different story. Not because Vader is significantly weaker there or anything, but because the feats of the non-Force users especially Boba Fett and Han Solo are so much better there."

He is also prohibited from killing anyone. • If Kakashi can survive for a year he will be transported back to the Narutoverse. Can he keep Gotham safe? Will he crumble under the pressure of being a superhero?","Absolutely he can. If anything he will only have to learn western society and how he can integrate that into his espionage skills. We have seen that he can deal with deities such as Pain and he knows how to feel out opponents until he goes in for the kill shot. Sharingan is a cheat code because he can just hypnotize someone and win every hand to hand fight since he sees it coming. He has the ninja dogs which make his scouting work way easier and having dogs in the middle of the night in the streets of Gotham only makes Kakashis job easier.

The USA doesn't have access to any modern day weapons like guns, tanks, military aircraft, missiles etc etc. They can use aircraft and vehicles for transportation but cannot use them in battle. So you can't just run them over. Weapons allowed are swords, bows/crossbows, and any other non projectile/non explosive weapon. The mongols spawn in Canada and seek to take over the states, the USA is unaware until after the first attack. win condition being forcing the USA to surrender or control 51% or greater of the land. Win condition for USA is the complete defeat of the mongols.","Barbed wire is one of the most effective weapons in battlefield history. Radio changed warfare forever. Instant, nation-wide communication and co-ordination. Planes and satellites make recon virtually instant. Military engineers are tremendous difference makers. Riding on horseback is exhausting.

"argumenta sobre: 15 men in good physical conditions armed with spears vs all land animals. Extinct animals are included The guys know to use the spears very well and have experience in hunting. Also, they will have basic information of the animal that they will hunt. Edit1: I forgot to say that the guys will recover from each hunt. Edit2: The guys will fight just one of each land animal.","Depending on the length of the spears they clear modern day relatively easily with elephants, bears and hippos being the most difficult match ups. Once we get to dinosaurs it becomes quite a different thing, I think the humans have a good shot at most of them with the exception of the large herbivores that strike with their long tails like diplodocus, they have the added advantage of being so large it would be difficult to reach their vitals with the spears. I think the predatory dinos will perhaps counter-intuitively be easier to kill for a group of men armed with spears as the predator will come to them and likely put its head within stabbing range attempting to bite."
"argumenta sobre: Ash Ketchum gets dropped into Marvel Earth-616. He can catch anyone with a Pokeball after defeating them in battle. How does he conquer the universe? He starts with one Gen1 starter or Pikachu and they can evolve like normal. His starting location is your choice. He starts with 6 regular Pokeballs. He can only have 6 captured people at a time but he can release anyone on his team to catch someone different. Anyone can be caught after Ash defeats but not killing them or severely weakens them in battle. Status effects ups his chances of capturing like in the game. Anyone captured will obey Ash just as a pokemon would, ignoring the overleveled rulewhere a pokemon too high of a level might not listen to commands. Mind resistance won't work. If they're captured, they'll obey no matter what. Ash is invulnerable and won't be targeted by attacks in or out of battle. The only way to defeat him is to defeat his team in battle. He can have up to 3v3 battles. Any extra opponents in the area will wait for the battle to be over Hospitals will act like Pokemon centers. His team will be be healed to full health no matter how grave the injury but they can't be resurrected if they happened to die in battle. How can he conquer the universe?","Can the heroes ""evolve"" similarly to Pokémon? For example, can Spiderman grow six arms at level 21? Can he evolve further if he's traded while holding a symbiote? Can Cap evolve into Wolf Cap after 8pm if you use a moon stone on him? Ironman seems the most obvious, going from his OG Armor to the more classic red and yellow armor to the nano bot armor."

They have taken over the ministry of magic and are going to go through with their plans against muggles. Can we win? Honestly what is protego going to do against a tank round to the head? Sure magic in HP is OP as heck but never underestimate modern armies. Also there are not that many hardcore followers of Voldemort, most are just scared and would fight against him if given the chance.","Isn't the issue that Harry Potter magic is extremely potent but no one in the setting actually uses it to fill potential? Example - it would be trivially easy for more powerful Death Eaters to use invisibility, teleportation and transfiguration to assassinate any world leader they choose and be gone before the alarm even sounds. It would hardly be any more difficult for a suitably skilled dark wizard to use the Imperious curse on a few generals/admirals and get some nuclear weapons flying - perhaps between India/Pakistan.

It readiness itself for a fight. The american abrams realizes theirs a really large enemy tank with unknown weapons that's not following its commands to shut off.

In any case, the hellhammer is 13.5M long and weighs 314 tonnes. M1 Abrams is 8M long, 66 tonnes. The hellhammer is not that much bigger, so the argument essentially boils down to how strong people think the armo if a hellhammer is.

With this and the respective strength and equipment of each type of marine, who takes these rounds? Round 1: Just the plain numbers, just the plain marines. Round 2: Each side can augment their ranks by replacing some of their marines with their support units and specialist infantry. What combinations could bring each side the win?

Was looking at my 50-cent ball-point pen and admiring how perfectly the machined steel ball fits into its tiny socket so here we go. All of 15th-century Europe is given the task of producing a single modern ball-point pen within 50 years or face annihilation by a magic force. The same magic force unites them, preventing all combat or conflict. They do not need to produce the same kind of ink. Can they do it? Round 1: They're given all the industry schematics for producing a ball-point pen but nothing else. Edit: Given how easily they can clear Round 1, I'm changing Round 2 from 1 pen to 1 million pens. Round 2: They're given all the industry knowledge, schematics, etc. for each step of the supply chain involved in producing a ball-point pen starting from raw materials. Meaning the materials and plans for all the machinery ever involved in the process. Basically, they have all the knowledge on how to build a 21st-century factory and its supply chains. However, they must produce 1 million pens in 50 years. Picked a million because from what I can google, the annual output of a small factory is in the millions of pens. They're a united continent with 50 years. Hopefully, it's fair. Bonus: If not, when is the earliest time a united Europe could accomplish it?","I think people are underestimating how tricky ballpoint pens are to produce.

To everyone saying Gravity would win, gravity is by far the weakest out of all the other forces. About 10^36 times weaker than Electromagnetism.

"argumenta sobre: Dumbledore is given the complete Harry Potter series on Harry's first day at Hogwarts. What is he able to achieve with his newly gained knowledge? His main goals in a best case scenario: Voldemort is killed Harry survives Sirius's name is cleared and Pettigrew is charged/imprisoned Barty Crouch Jr. is recaptured Quirrell, Lockhart and Umbridge get whatever comeuppance is appropriate for them No casualties i.e. Cedric lives, Sirius lives, Dumbledore himself lives The way it works: The story will progress as it originally does for as long as Dumbledore refrains from directly altering it. For instance, he could try to apprehend Voldemort/Quirrell on the first night if he wanted to, but this would massively change how the story would pan out. Alternatively for example, he could go straight to the Room of Requirement and retrieve the Diadem horcrux and destroy it, with this change not having a real effect for years to come. For me, the major problem surrounds the part of Voldemort's soul that's in Harry. For Harry to survive the destruction of this, his blood would still need to be used in Voldemort's regeneration, which would likely mean a dead Cedric. Can Dumbledore overcome this? What's the best outcome he could achieve for the wizarding world?","Simple. Ask Ron Weasley to please come to his office with his rat, as he has reason to believe it has magical properties. Cast the spell to force an Animagus to return to normal on the rat, revealing Peter Pettigrew. Have him sent to Azkaban. Without Pettigrew, it's highly unlikely Voldemort would ever return, or at the very least, it would be delayed incredibly - possible even until after Harry's natural death. He could then systematically wipe out the Horcruxes while Voldemort was still in spirit form, leaving just Harry remaining. Their defences are worthless against someone who knows what they are; the only one which still poses a threat is the locket, which he wouldn't need to go after anyway, since at the time Dumbledore gains his knowledge, it's locked up in Grimmauld place. By the time Voldemort returns, if ever, Dumbledore could simply sit an adult Harry down after grooming him to be a reasonable human being, and explain the situation. Alternatively, if Dumbledore is willing to break all of his morals, there's another tactic which could spare Harry's life; Dementors. By coercing Dementors the same way the Ministry does, Dumbledore could potentially get them 'on side'. When he does this, he could then reveal Pettigrew, as stated before, but instead place him under the Imperius curse, and arrange for Voldemort's resurrection; while preparing a trap for Voldemort at the resurrection site. At the moment Voldemort comes back, Dumbledore enters, duels and defeats him, and gives him to the Dementors to be kissed. After that, the Horcruxes can be destroyed as normal, in case the soul fragments inside them pose any threat."
"argumenta sobre: Four men that are permanently hopped up on Adderall with indestructible shovels vs a sentient Jeep Wrangler with an IQ of 5000 The arena is a 70m by 70m square, with iron walls surrounding the plot of land. The ground is soft dirt, which is exactly 2 meters deep, but after those two meters, you hit solid iron. Any manipulation of this dirt is allowed. The men cannot enter the Jeep, nor can they puncture the tires with their shovels. They also cannot open the valve to the gas tank. They can, however, hit the car with their shovels, and in the event that the Jeep flips, they can dismantle the Jeep from the bottom. All other orifices are fair game. The Jeep is a standard 2017 Jeep Wrangler with unlimited gas. Your average Jeep Wrangler comes in at about 1,800 kg with a top speed of 140 mph 225 kph. Win condition for the Jeep is killing all four men. Win condition for the men is making the Jeep inoperable. The men have 30 minutes of prep time before the Jeep is lowered into the arena via helicopter. Assume that the helicopter does not mess up any of the dirt on the ground that the men may or may not have manipulated during the prep time. Thirst and hunger are not a problem, but stamina is.","I don't think an IQ of 5000 is a thing. From what I remember it can't measure that high, even above 150 or so measurements tend to get less accurate. So if it was possible to have an IQ of 5000, I think that thing that smart would pretty much auto win no pun intended. Humans only became the alpha predators on earth because we are so much smarter than everything else. This fight would be an gnat trying to beat us in chess. Humans are able to scare off lions from their food with real technology, and lions have no right being afraid of a human without any tools, but we make them run away. This poindexter of a car would be able to beat the 4 humans in ways we can't even begin to think about."

The T-800 is an infiltration unit, extremely flexible in its approach.

They do not tire, do not eat, do not sleep. It will walk through the bottom of the sea or climb through mountains if it needs to, and it can utilize that to get to its objective. I'd give it a very high chance of achieving the objective, alone, with minimal issues. Especially if it just disguises itself as an orc when it reaches Mordor - it can flay an orc and put on a fleshsuit if needs be, that should be enough for it to pass at a glance from far away. &x200B; R3 - Boned, in this scenario we're losing all advantages of both the Fellowship and the Terminator &x200B; Bonus Round - I can't find a way for a T-1000 to lose this, even if it goes into retard mode and forgets its basic programming as per the R1 stipulation."

"argumenta sobre: Superman decides he's just gonna end Lex Luthor. Can Luthor survive? Lex Luthor is very dependent on the fact that Superman doesn't kill or violate laws. This is one of his major advantages, and it's often said that if Superman wanted to, he could easily just kill him. Let's test it! Superman decides that he's sick of this shit. This time, he's not going to wait for Lex to come up with some scheme his lawyers have already prepared to exonerate him from. This time, he's going to pick him up and throw him in the sun and let's see his 8th-level intellect get out of that. So. Can it? Superman is semi-bloodlusted: that is, he's bent on killing Luthor and will gladly kill Luthor's goons, but he still won't hurt innocent bystanders. He's still Superman. He'll kill Lex-corp employees if he has to, but he'll try not to if they're not actively attacking him or protecting Lex. The Justice League and other superheroes have decided to wash their hands of this: they won't stop him or protect Lex, but they won't help Superman out either. Three scenarios 1. Watching videos of the Justice League's latest adventure, Lex figures out, being a genius, that in a week Superman is going to snap. He has that long to prepare himself. 2. Superman is giving a press conference, and Lex realizes he's going to snap. There's about two hours left of the press conference, and after that he's coming. Lex has until then to prepare. 3. Lex Luthor realizes superman has snapped when he flies in through his window with his eyes glowing red and says he's going to kill him. Lex has the 60 seconds before Superman's speech is over to come up with something.","If superman loses all restraint then I don't think lex has any offensive measures that would be enough. That said for round 1 and 2 i'm pretty sure Lex can get into a defensive position involving kryptonite that would prevent superman from killing him. In round 3 unless he's within 60 seconds of a bunker nothing can save him, because it won't be second 61 before he dies."

Super speed and super reflexes as well as any secondary abilities to protect him: scaled to the best slow-mo camera in the world.

The phrase was always ""if ya smell what the Rock is cooking"", meaning that the Rock's cooking would presumably indeed have a strong smell, but it's entirely conditional on IF you smell what is cooking. Any hero who doesn't need to breathe/smell would have no idea that the Rock was cooking anything. Furthermore, if one could smell what the Rock was cooking before he arrived, it also would confirm a strong smell of the cooking but could also be a disadvantage. Any hero with a superior sense of smell would be able to detect the Rock's cooking way before the Rock could get close enough to attack. So the answer could actually be Wolverine. Logan isn't immune to electricity, maybe more vulnerable depending on how well adamantium conducts current. He would be able to survive a forceful rectum insertion but likely wouldn't be able to prevent it, the Rock is stronger and faster than Logan. Logan would be able to smell the Rock's cooking from a distance but otherwise would be powerless to stop the Rock. The real evidence the Rock would be able to beat Logan is the last premise.

To those of you who do not play computer games I will break down for you what that means. Your average human operates at 60 frames a second if your there your golden things look like a movie. 30 frames a second is passable but still looks a bit off and it doesn't look as good as 60. 15 is where things get crusty you can actully see the game buffering as you play and updating your frame rate but you can still manage. This is the least amount of frames I will play with before calling it a night. 7 is the least ammount of frames you can have and still be playable at all. It updates frames very slowly and while you can still play in theory it isn't fun at all. At 1 frame per second things get very surreal, dialogue comes out like. A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A and then it jumped forward to the next frame which is just as incoherent as the last. Every second loops the animation and sound extremely fast. You literally can't do anything when this happens, in game I call it a night and turn my computer off but it almost doesn't happen. So someone in 1fps would be teleporting forward five or so feet ever second and repeating the same syllable until a second has passed. Can someone actually function in society with such garbage fps?

The Space Marine is in full combat armor, trained for centuries in warfare, and currently in a berserker-like rage. He's not holding back. This is a fight to the death. No retreat, no reinforcements. Just pure, brutal chaos. Who walks away?","Depends on the writer, but most likely Space Marine. Even in a a blind rage, a marine is still a hypno-trained tactical savant with reaction times vastly in excess of a gorilla. Unlikely the first five gorillas even see him move. Incidentally you first say without armor and then say he's allowed combat armor, but it doesn't change my answer much. If we let him have the power armour then he's not even breaking a sweat."

Cap has his shield and Civil War suit. He starts inside the main gates of King's Landing. He must get through every single Goldcloak, Lannister soldier stationed in the city, and Kingsguard with the final bosses being The Hound and Ser Barristan. No stealth or sneaky shit.","Imagine a guy much more agile than The Mountain, several times stronger than The Mountain, and give him an indestructible shield that he can fire like a cannon and guess how well he does in a universe where The Mountain was one of the peak fighters.

"argumenta sobre: The Joker, Hannibal Lecter, Jack Sparrow, and Mr. Bean in psychological battle Four of thems lock in a cell together, who will driven insane by who?","I feel like people are underrating Mr Bean here. He's not an average human with maxed luck, he's a literal space alien / extraplanar entity see the original opening where he's thrown to Earth in a beam of light. He doesn't display any non-human powers, but his cognition is anything but earthly. Lector beats Sparrow easily - Sparrow's layers of description and inscrutable behavior would intrigue and occasionally confuse Lector, but Sparrow is also an utter mess of neuroses. Once Lector has time to peel back the surface layers, he'll pick Sparrow apart with trivial ease. Joker varies widely by incarnation, but in some ways is actually more stable than Sparrow. At worst he's just another mark or loses immediately since he's already insane, but at best he can spar on Lector's level. On average, I think Lector takes him after an extended battle. Mr Bean would probably just twiddle his thumb in the corner or putter around in the initial stages. He wouldn't understand or be invested in the contest - and if he was, his best move would just be to poke someone repeatedly. He's the least proactive of the four, so I think Lector will attack the other two first and likely win. But I think, as Lector begins to analyze him in earnest, the alien architecture of Mr Bean's mind would disturb and confuse Lector. I think Mr Bean would confound him at every turn, and wear him down with sheer banality. I think Mr Bean takes this."
"argumenta sobre: United States of America vs one person - who can survive the longest? The government of the United States unanimously decides the urgent priority on their agenda is to have one select person dead. Here are the rules: They know the person's appearance, full legal name as well as any nicknames, if relevant, and country of residence. The government is willing to use any and all resources available to them. They are willing to violate international law, but they are still mindful of possible consequences. So probably no full-scale invasion of China. They want to minimize collateral damage and casualities, so no nuclear weapons and similar means unless it is necessary. The human has one hour warning. Who on earth do you think can survive the longest in this scenario?",Mr. Beast. Give him an hour and he'd convince a million people to storm the seat of U.S. government for a chance at 10 million dollars.
argumenta sobre: Aragorn Lord of the Rings and Jaime Lannister A song of Ice and Fire switch places. Who does better? Aragorn wakes up in King's Landing while Jaime Lannister appears at the Prancing Pony. They are seen as the character they replaced by outsiders and they have the memories of the character they replaced in addition to their own. They retain their equipment and physique. &x200B; Who gets farther? Will Jaime Lannister fight off the orcs and help defeat Sauron? Will Aragorn get caught by the Starks or fend off the White Walkers?,"Aragorn is a Ranger who happens to be a hell of a swordsman. Jamie is a Knight. Aragorn could manage Jamie's path because he's broadly skilled and quite a bit older than the Lannister. He's also got a massive physical advantage over any human in GOT. GOT is basically a human tale told with human characters. In that setting, Aragorn would be clearly superhuman. As such, Aragorn would do better from virtually the start with the possible exception of him getting assassinated. Flipside, Jamie lacks many of the skills that got Aragorn to where he was at the start of the LotR. He would probably succumb to the ring when the hobbits first exposed him to it. I doubt he'd make it to Rivendell."

argumenta sobre: Steve Minecraft is tasked with building a Death Star within Six Months. Can he do it? He has all the equipment needed to construct a Death Star. He'll build the Death Star on Earth. R1: Survival Mode Steve R2: Creative Mode R3: Permanent Potion of Swiftness Building Speed Buff + Assuming he's Massively Hypersonic in Base Edit: Clarification. It doesn't need to be up to scale. Just needs to be moderately big and have the functioning Laser Beam.,"Well, cheap answer is no, because the build height limit is far far smaller than even the lowball estimates for the death star size. But seriously, no freakin way. The deathstar according to google is 160km in diameter. Which is probably not true since that's so much smaller than a moon no one would intendify it as a that nor could you see it with the naked eye in daylight on a planet, but let's go with it for now. If the diameter is 160km and a single block in minecraft is 3ft ish or 1m ish then that's 160,000 cubes just to do the diameter. It would mean that the volume of the deathstar is approximately 2,144,660,584,850,630 cubes. Even if we assume that the number of cubes is three quarters hollow, in order to do it in 6 months you'd need to lay 34,003,370 blocks per second without ever stopping"

"argumenta sobre: Teddy Roosevelt is given a high powered rifle and 3 days to hunt down all 45 other Presidents of the United States across Yellowstone Park. How many can he kill? Teddy is on horseback and has a high powered rifle with scope, two pistols, a hunting knife, and a can-do attitude. He has no moral qualms about hunting down his unfortunate co-presidents and collecting their scalps as trophies. The other 45 Presidents' only prep time is a rudimentary wildlife survival course. They are each equipped with 3 days worth of food and water and placed on the shore of Yellowstone Lake along with a cornucopia containing tents, compasses, maps, hiking gear, but no weapons. The presidents have a 6 hour head-start on Teddy, which counts as his prep time. He has access to detailed maps of Yellowstone and can take them with him into the park along with any other non-weaponry as long as it fits on horseback. Teddy can enter Yellowstone from whichever direction he pleases. The whole park is empty aside from the 46 Presidents and is surrounded by the National Guard to prevent anyone from entering or leaving the park. It is peak summer, so no president will accidentally die of hypothermia, although wild animals still pose a risk. R1: All presidents are taken from the period of time during their presidency where they were at their physical and mental peak. R2: All presidents are taken from the day after they retired from politics. For presidents who died in office, they are taken 29 days before their death. All surviving presidents, including the incumbent, are their current age. Teddy only has 2 days in this scenario, but knows the Presidents are all grouped on Yellowstone Lake. R3: All presidents are taken from the last full day before their death/serious incapacitation that led to death. Teddy only has one day, however he now has access to a 4x4 Land Rover that he instinctively knows how to drive, but in return must sacrifice at least one president to Old Faithful. FDR also has access to the same wheelchair that Stephen Hawking has in the Simpsons. EDIT: Wow, did not expect to see this much Jackson love.

"argumenta sobre: The Vatican is given notice of Paimon's Cult targeting the Grahams, can they save them?Hereditary Part of the tragedy of Hereditary is how the Grahams' fate was pretty much decided before the movie even started, with the grandmother leading the cult and essentially raising her children and grandchildren to be sacrifices for Paimon. However, what if the Vatican/Catholic Church was given notice of the cultists activities before certain time frames? Could the Church have saved them from their fate, using the occult knowledge and possibly even firepower to do so. For the sake of the challenge, the Church is allowed harm/kill people only in self defense, e.g. a cultists or possessed person tries to attack them. Round 1: The church finds out about the plot the day after Charlie is killed. Round 2: The church finds out a week before Charlie is supposed to be killed.

"argumenta sobre: The Tyranids invade the Star Trek Milky Way, with a proper scenario Setting The Milky Way is as of 2363: Picard has just been assigned to command the Enterprise-D. The Q are out of the picture. In case of canon conflicts, the TV show takes precedence over movies, and both take precedence over books, comics etc The Tyranids have spread Genestealers across several systems in the Alpha and Beta quadrants. They have been detected in several spots, but no one has yet connected the dots to the larger plot, much less figured that they are the vanguards of a massive invasion. The Tyranids invade as of the Third Tyrannic War, marked as Hive Fleet Leviathan on this map: For comparison, the point marked Gryphonne IV on the 40k map corresponds to the edge of Kilngon space in the Beta quadrant. Holy Terra would be Earth. The Hive Mind aims to sweep through Klingon territory, taking out the militaristic Klingons, before descending on the Federation. Gravimetric disturbances and Shadow in the Warp The Tyranids travel by manipulating gravity through unknown means; this lets them ""lock onto"" a target system and accelerate their fleets towards it at ""low"" FTL speeds, while simultaneously causing gravimetric disturbances that affect both the suns and the planets at their destination. Anomalous solar activity, powerful earthquakes, huge tidal waves, comet strikes and similar typically herald a Tyranid invasion. As the Tyranids approach, the immense psychic chatter of the Hive Mind begins to blot out the local Warp. For the purposes of this scenario, we assume that the Milky Way has a calm Warp, with no Chaos and no daemons; sentients have souls, and can both suffer and exhibit psychic effects. This is what Federation science currently understands as ""telepathic energy"" or ""psionic energy"", though they haven't begun to scratch the true depths of it. This psychic blotting is called the Shadow in the Warp, and causes extensive effects. Paranoia and despair, doomsday cults, mental breakdowns become common. Combined with the gravimetric disrturbances, this throws target worlds into turmoil long before the Tyranids make planetfall. The combined effect of these phenomena eventually renders 40k-style Warp travel impossible within the affected systems. For the purposes of this scenario, we assume that Star Trek style Warp travel is also impossible once the Tyranids have reached a system, and until they are routed/destroyed. Diplomacy In case there's any doubt, the Hive Mind is not diplomatically approachable in the slightest. Genestealers play the political game only so long as it serves their ends. Basically, there's no chance of peace with the Hive Mind: it has to be defeated. Diplomacy between the various Milky Way factions starts as normal for the setting, but can evolve in light of the Tyranid invasion.",I think the Star Strek galaxy is toasted. They for sure have the technology to do something to the swarm but they don't have the speed. There is just going to be way too many tyranids to deal with attacking way too many places at once.

Irinya caught him, near effortlessly, by the throat, and held him in mid-air. His legs kicked impotently, like one of the hanging victims in the gardens beyond the walls.

The deck rippled under her, flexing like fluid, and she staggered away. Too slow. A big joist came loose overhead, knocked out of its moorings by the excavator's movement. It was solid iron, ten yards long, and as soon as she saw it come for her she knew she couldn't escape it. All she could do was watch it topple, swinging down in the dark like the hammer of vengeance. The memory of Oolenta suddenly flashed in front of her, all that guilt and anxiety cradled so carefully for so long, now pointlessly, because this was going to end her. Except it didn't. Something interposed itself, something dark and glinting and armoured, surging up out of the shadow and dust to brace the toppling beam.

I also don't know if you consider him to be ridiculously overpowered. It also doesn't really come down to how much power they have. IT is more of an eldritch-type horror than a traditional villain. Strange could always discover the ritual and send Tony with knowledge of it. The armor wouldn't help him all that much, either, since it isn't about combat.

By allowing the entire Imperium with the Emperor to put everything into the conquest, it means that the Emperor himself can get involved. Even 'normal' alpha psykers can control entire star system populations. Even without the involvement of Psykers; unstoppable orbital bombardment targeted at all key leadership and infrastructural locations would force an unconditional surrender in under an hour. A more interesting question would be how many infantry it would take for a takeover without any backup."
"argumenta sobre: weakest species that can defeat the kurzgesagt ducks so, the kurzgesagt ducks are fairly powerful imo, havng nukes, dyson spheres, black hole bombs, many of them survive being in proximity to actual stars and so much more &x200B; i wanna see the limits","So in this case I feel that the birds have Warhammer orc style reality breaking abilities. Whatever they want to do, they have the technology to do so, and with no care for their personal safety. In different videos they're shown time traveling casually, have society stability to survive until the end of time, make black hole bombs right next to a planet with no care, and transmute matter into gold. All of this seems to indicate a hive mind. Why worry about any one individual when all are one? With that unsupported assumption I'm not sure any being ior civilization without the ability to change dimensions or warp reality on the scale of the universe can defeat them since it even one remains they'll do sometime like build a teleporter to warp a piece of a neutron star on top of their adversary while calmly explaining how they are melting away oceans in microseconds."
"argumenta sobre: An ""actual"" whowouldwin situation from the 1980 film ""The Final Countdown"" – the USS Nimitz is sent back in time to December 6, 1941. Can she stop Pearl Harbor? It was an actual film, and it was pretty good so I won't spoil it, so… …if the USS Nimitz as she was armed in 1980, fully fueled and armed with all her aircraft, was sent back in time to the day before Pearl Harbor, with all the knowledge of what was about to happen, and located 200 miles off of Hawaii so in range, could she stop the attack?","Easily, there is nothing IJN could do against Harpoon missiles. Nimitz would prioritize Harpoon on IJN aircraft carriers followed by supply ships and destroyers because they have far less armors. I believe Japanese did not have air search radar yet, not until 1943/44, so they wouldn't even know where or what direction Harpoons came from IJN fleet would be in total disarray at this point, Nimitz would launch strike aircrafts to finish off fleeing battleships and cruisers. Attack on Pearl Harbor order of battle - Wikipedia Besides time travel, the most unbelievable part in the movie was how a Japanese pilot managed to disarm a Marine guard, took his M16 and killed multiple crews with it. Given Japanese pilot would have only used a pistol, and maybe at best a Type38 bolt rifle in the boot camp, he's most unlikely able to chamber a M16 or turn off safety before he was disarmed by other guards. Japan in WW2 never fielded automatic weapons in large numbers outside machineguns, so an automatic rifle would be fairly foreign to a pilot especially at this stage of war."
"argumenta sobre: Strongest character an IRL sniper can kill A sniper from our world is given a device that allows him to travel to any fictional universe he wants, and his goal is to kill the strongest character there is. He is guaranteed to make the first shot with perfect accuracy, however if a second shot is needed, the character he is hunting might notice, but it is still allowed. In this scenario, ""strongest"" is defined by the capacity for destruction e.g. Magneto is extremely powerful but a regular bullet could kill him provided he does not have his magnetic shield up","Superman, Kryptonite bullet to the skull does the trick"
"argumenta sobre: Tiger VS Human This post is mainly to settle an argument between me and a buddy. Some background information: My buddy is a power lifter, about 6'4, 225 pounds of pure muscle. Can deadlift about 605 pounds, squat about 500, and bench press about 365. He insists that in the scenario of a fully grown tiger charging after him, he could kill it. His technique is to put his arm up, let the tiger bite his forearm then gouge its eyes. He does admit that he would probably lose his arm, but in the end he would win. I insisted that the tiger would easily obliterate him in one swift move but he still strongly believes that he would come out victorious so it's time to settle the argument.","Surprised I've not seen this yet, what a lot of cats do as they jump at things is bring their back feet up, so assuming your friend is the god of tasty looking forearms, the tiger go for his arm with its mouth. The front legs probably go to each of his side's, ripping massive gashes in his side's/back, then the back legs land around his stomach and rip downwards, turning what used to be abs into what now would like like if you pushed raw sausage through one of those play-dough extruders. If by some miracle your friend is still lucid and focused, he goes for the eyes with his other hand right? He somehow manages to hit both eyes with one hand while the tiger is shaking its head, ripping open his arm, sides/back and his intestines are hanging out? Maybe your mate could kill the tiger with the pure weight of the bullshit coming out of his mouth instead."

"argumenta sobre: Could Conan the Barbarian beat a stranded PredatorYautja? Who would win, Conan the Barbarian or a Predator? Setting: The Predator is flying near Hyboria and crashlands in the jungle. He alternates between searching the ruins for any technology he can potentially use to fix his ship and hunting. He doesnt quite understand how magic works on Hyboria so he thinks it may be technological. He begins hunting in the jungles near to a town and word spreads of some sort of creature killing townsfolk nearby. Conan is in town and is intrigued by what he hears and decides to hunt the creature for sport. He knows the creature can go invisible, is large, strong, agile, and is known to attack from trees as often as on the ground. He gets prepared and heads into the jungle. Location: Jungle and nearby magical ruins. The Jungle is filled with all sorts of normally nasty things. The Ruins have typical Conan-esque magics in them. Giant snake statues that come alive, ghosts tricking you, etc. Equipment: Conan has his sword and a bow and provisions. The Predator has his basic kit minus anything ranged. He is melee and armor only unless he makes something himself. Suppose his more advanced gear is broken in the crash. Who would win? I think this would be a really close match. Conan has homefield advantage and is just as eager to fight the Predator as it is him. The Predator will probably get the drop on him but compared to other situations Conan has ended up in, one really strong invisible guy isnt that big of a threatwith prep.

"argumenta sobre: Ivan Drago from ""Rocky IV"" is a real boxer now. Is there any IRL boxer who could defeat him in a boxing match? Ivan Drago from ""Rocky IV"" is basically a Soviet supersoldier, who can punch with a force varying from 1850 to 2150 psi per square inch. He was strong enough to absolutely manhandle and beat Apollo Creed, who's a heavyweight boxing champion, to death in a boxing match. Rocky Balboa has barely defeated him in a very tough boxing match, which caused Rocky to retire due to the brain damage although it was retconned later. Now, let's imagine that Ivan Drago is real. According to the official information from the ""Rocky"" franchise, Ivan Drago is 6'7"" tall and weights 268 lbs, while his reach is 80 inches. As an amateur boxer, Drago has defeated every boxer in USSR and became the undisputed world amateur champion before turning into a pro and before getting the enhancementts. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ivan Drago returned to pro boxing and accumulated an impressive record of 31 wins all by KO and only 1 loss to Rocky Balboa while also winning the heavyweight champion title. Is there any real life boxer, who could've defeated Ivan Drago in a boxing match let's say it would be a 12 rounds match? Fight would happen in a boxing ring under the conventional boxing rules.","His technique was bad but he had the power to literally kill you in the ring. Heavyweights with superior speed and technique like Larry Holmes, Ali, Lennox Lewis could avoid him and counter him to a victory on decision. Maybe even someone like prime Evander Holyfield could get the job done because he was on the smaller side and wasn't the strongest puncher but his relentless pressure could be trouble for anyone."
"argumenta sobre: A regular man gains the ability to fly. In what sports does he immediately become the GOAT? In what sports does he become a legitimate pro-league player? In what sports does he gain no advantage in? This man is 25 and of average height, weight, and strength. He flies via ""walking on air"", meaning he does not grow wings or have to flap his arms or anything; rather, he needs to move his legs as if he were walking/running to fly. His max speed while flying is the same as his max speed when running. Flying takes the same amount of energy and effort as running at the same speed. For example, if he is flying at 5m/s, he would be spending the same amount of energy as if he were running at 5m/s. This applies to flying in any direction. He still takes fall damage but, of course, he can still control his downward speed to make sure he doesn't take a hard fall. There is no height limit to his flying.

"argumenta sobre: When Sokka and Katara broke open the ice of the South Pole, instead of Aang they find a man with a star-spangled outfit and a red white and blue shield. Could Captain America take down the Firelord before the arrival of Sozin's Comet? As Katara is lashing out at her brother's attitude, she unknowingly causes a massive rift to break in the ice and reveals the submerged wreckage of a strange metal craft unlike anything the two have ever seen. As they venture downwards to explore the metal husk they find buried beneath the snow a red, white, and blue shield made of the strongest metal they've ever known. Sokka excitedly goes to dig it up with his club when Katara notices another strange feature in the ice... a man frozen in time. Against Sokka's advice she melts the ice around the man's body and, to their surprise, he begins to breathe. The man introduces himself as Steve Rogers, a super soldier from a country that doesn't exist who brought an end to the greatest war of his time. The three become friends and make their journey back to the Southern Water Tribe where it's revealed Katara is the last waterbender in the South Pole while Sokka is the oldest male in his village as the rest have gone off to fight in the war. Heartbroken by the existence of another global conflict, Steve meets the two's grandmother who senses that the power Steve possesses, both in body and heart, is exactly what could help win the Hundred Years War. And if it's really true he brought an end to the greatest conflict of his time, perhaps he could stop the greatest conflict of theirs. Unable to turn down a call to help, Steve accepts this mission and asks where the rest of the village's men went. Not wanting to abandon their new friend or miss the chance to see their dad, Sokka and Katara insist they go too, and the three board a boat and set off to find the rest of the water tribe's forces. Now only one question remains: Can Captain America take down Firelord Ozai before the arrival of Sozin's Comet? THE CHALLENGE When Steve went into the ice in '45, he could have never imagined this would be the world he'd wake up in. Not only has he lost everyone he knew, but even the country he stands for no longer exists. But although he now lives in a world with elemental powers, he's still Captain America. His leadership skills are unmatched and he's still far tougher and stronger than the average soldier. Whether it takes an army or just a few close allies, Cap's going to be determined to do whatever it takes to stop the Hundred Years War. Seeing how there was no beam of light to alert of the Avatar's return, Zuko and the rest of the world would have no reason to suspect the gang as a threat for the time being. With the right help, Steve might be able to use the technology in the downed aircraft to help aid his advancement should he acquire the help of someone like the Mechanist Then again, so could the Fire Nation if they discover the wreckage. BONUS CHALLENGE The same time Cap is broken free of the ice, Zuko's ship comes across a strange glowing blue cube in the icy waters of the South Pole. As it's pulled onto the vessel Zuko senses the immense power that is held within it and soon enough finds out about it's capabilities. With the power of the Tesseract, Zuko poses far more of a threat to the gang and anyone else envious of his power. Ozai especially may have something to say about it. Just how differently might things turn out? Alternatively...",I think the gang would have a fairly good change cause Zuko would give zero shits about them if they didn't have the Avatar. No one would even see them as a threat until they finally choose to attack. By then they would probably have some sorta plan together. Zuko might try to fight them if he gets some ways-to-regain-honor-creatively skills but other wise I think he'd mostly ignore it. Maybe he'd be forced to come to some sort of 'oh-shit-wars-bad moment of his own though. Gang would probably need to do a lot more recruitment stuff cause Cap isn't as OP as Aang but he'd probably have some good knowledge and strategic stuff they could use. Plus his shield would be helpful

Okay so I've been playing Another Crab's Treasure great game, hope to see it on this sub eventually and a lot of the enemies use everyday items as weapons, like drinking straws and cotton swabs, because they're small. That got me thinking: if humans were that small, what would be the strongest everyday item we could use as a weapon? For the sake of this prompt, let's shrink an average human down to six inches tall with lifting strength shrunk to a reasonable proportion as well. Let's also assume that the shrunken human can't craft a small version of an actual weapon like a sword.

"argumenta sobre: How the Hell can the cast of the Simpsons get their show cancelled in one episode? The entire cast of The Simpsons becomes aware that they're in a show and is determined to get it cancelled. They have one episode to do this, during which they are in control of their own actions, in-setting. However, they cannot simply do whatever they want in this episode - after it's done being ""produced"", a bored executive from the real-world network will look over it. They are not aware that the Simpsons are real or sentient, unaware that this episode is being sabotaged, etc - they think it's just a normal cartoon episode that they need to do a quick check for problems in. If they see anything obviously, glaringly wrong to the point where it can't be shown on TV, the episode will be skipped and the Simpsons lose. In short, the episode needs to look, at first glance, like a reasonable episode of the modern Simpsons, but have something so terribly wrong with it under the surface that it will get the entire series permanently canceled after it airs, all on its own. Is there anything they could do to accomplish this? If they're unable to do so, could they do it if the episode went straight to TV, with no review process? If they fail, after one episode everything will be reset and they'll forget they're in a show, forever. Nothing that happens in the episode is guaranteed to stick - eg. if they all die, the next episode can just treat it like a gag and have them be alive.","Juat put porn in the background of one scene.

"argumenta sobre: A Message on AI Hello WhoWouldWin Community I hope you're all doing well! As your moderator, I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for your passion and enthusiasm in our discussions. It's incredible to see so many different perspectives and creative arguments about the battles between our favorite characters. Remember to keep the debates respectful and enjoyable for everyone. If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the subreddit, feel free to reach out. Your input is always appreciated! Let's keep the discussions going and continue to make this a great space for all fans! Best, Wait a Second …Something feels off, doesn't it? I would never say something like that! I hate all of you. Well, there's one simple reason behind this: I asked ChatGPT to write that segment up. Technology has progressed to such an impressive state, we're now able to flawlessly replicate the soulless husk of corporate America speak. With these newfound advancements comes one problem though… the bots are amongst us. WhoWouldWin is facing a serious concern of increased AI activity. Why is this happening? From what I've heard, individuals are farming accounts with karma with the intent of selling them off, but don't take that as gospel. What I do know is that these accounts have no place here. While I'm sure we're all looking forward to the Singularity as much as the next guy, and would prefer to avoid drawing the ire of Roko's basilisk, it shouldn't come at the cost of human inconvenience. Bots that do stuff like provide links to Respect Threads are awesome! A bot pretending to be a person? Not so much. We're banning them on sight. That's why we need you to stay vigilant and report false accounts. What to Look For - Karma: A botted account will typically have no posts of its own, and therefore only have one post karma point. This is different from comment karma, but please be aware this is not always true, and AI users are capable of having widely upvoted posts. - Name: These accounts are manufactured quickly, so they'll usually again, not always select the usernames generated by Reddit itself. That means anyone with a word, a second word, and a number for their username is a viable suspect. Strangely, a lot of bots come equipped with first names as well with Luna being a popular one in an attempt to seem more natural. - Comments: Pretty simple one, which I'm sure many of you have picked up on already. These accounts have a tendency to not contribute to conversation, in favor of expounding about the epic magnitude of the battle. And when they do select a winner, it's a wordy declaration, rather than an argument. They also really like exclamation marks for some reason. This one's easy. - Lack of Response: The dead giveaway in my experience. If you're worried someone was sent from Skynet, merely accuse them and see what happens. If you hear nothing back, you were right on the money. Please be aware this means we'll be taking a 'shoot first, ask questions later' approach whenever we're on the fence for banning users. If we thought you were a bot, tell us how stupid we are in modmail and you'll be unbanned right away. No harm, no foul. Closing Remarks So yeah, if we all work together, maybe we'll be able to make the dead internet theory a little less plausible, and put artificial intelligence back where it belongs: producing movies, television and video games. This is also a problem affecting subreddits others than , so spread the word and keep an eye out however you can. Unfortunately, all of this is a bandaid solution until the admins of Reddit up their game, but what can you do? If you're more of a visual learner however, here are some examples of AI accounts which you can study at home. All of these have been banned already, so don't worry about reporting them. - Example 1 - Easy Mode - Example 2 - Normal Mode - Example 3 - Hard Mode - As a heads up this account is NSFW Also please note that our 'no downvoting' rule applies to people only.

Goku being who he is decides to enter the tournament and battle. Somehow he manages to beat people like Rex and Weevil. Come towards the end of the tournament and Goku makes it all the way to the Pharaoh in the semi finals. The Pharaoh senses a weird aura from Goku and doesn't like it, he doesn't understand ki energy. So the Pharaoh turns it into a shadow game and tells Goku if he loses he's going to be trapped there forever. I feel like the Pharaoh would win easily, heart of the cards but can he keep Gokus soul trapped.","Season 0 Pharoah would stand the best chance. He should be able to start a shadow game in another dimension, bring Goku and win the game. In Season 0, a lot of the shadow dimension stuff is just mind breaking. So yeah it should work. If you mean like an actual shadow dimension, then Goku just instant transmissions out Not really a battle though. Goku could probably speed blitz Yugi before it happened or just never be in a scenario where Yami could call a shadow game."
argumenta sobre: Everyone in the United States below the age of 18 vs everyone above the age of 65 No firearms allowed but any other weapons are fine. The battle lasts at least 6 months. Who wins?,"Easily the kids. The amount of physically/mentally fit seniors is relatively low. Children as young as 8 could easily be trained to smother, kneecap, strangle, etc.. After that you just train everyone else in basic tackling and hand to hand combat techniques. From there you unleash the 8-10 year olds on the seniors above 90. The 12-14 year olds on the seniors above 80 and the 14-17 year olds take on the 65-79 demo. It would be an absolute slaughter"
"argumenta sobre: The Terminator has come to assassinate Sarah Conner at the police station, but this time the station is filled with action movie hero cops! Can the Terminator fight his way through the station or will he be sent to the junkyard in a body bag? In the movie the Terminator, the Terminator killed 17 cops trying to get to Sarah Conner. Could it do the same thing if all those cops were replaced with the most badass cops cinema has to offer or at least the most badass without repeating actors? The following hero cops are inside the station: Riggs and Murtaugh \Lethal Weapon\ John McClane \Die Hard\ Harry Callahan \Dirty Harry\ Johnny Utah and Pappas \Point Break\ Yan Naing Lee and James Carter \Rush Hour\ Tequila and Alan \Hard Boiled\ Axel Foley \Beverly Hills Cop\ Marion Cobretti aka Cobra \Cobra\ Nico Toscani aka Steven Seagal before he got fat \Above The Law\ Rama \The Raid\ Vincent Hanna \Heat\ Lahey and Randy \Trailer Park Boys\ these two start in the drunk tank Here is the police shootout in case you need to refresh your memory Everything starts the same with the Terminator smashing through the front doors of the station and killing the officer at the reception desk. All the hero cops are in the office area and have whatever weapon they would realistically have at their desk plus whatever they can get from the armoury. The Terminator wins if he makes it to the rear parking lot of the police station to see Sarah Conner escaping. The cops win if they destroy or immobilize the Terminator. BONUS: Judge Dredd \Karl Urban version\ versus the Terminator in an empty police station. Can Dredd take on the Terminator solo?","People are massively underselling John McClaine, who is a straight superhero in his later movies. We are talking about a dude who wins fights against helicopters and harrier jets among other things. Additionally both Axel Foley and the duo from Rush Hour have low level Toonforce. Others in the group like Johnny Utah and Dirty Harry are basically fodder, but I'm pretty sure the higher power ones can take this. Action Heroes 7/10"
"argumenta sobre: Can Humanity Survive: Every Domestic Dog is now a Hippo Every domestic/feral dog, even including wolfdogs, is now a hippopotamus. Can humanity survive man's best friend becoming hippos? The hippos arent bloodlusted and will act like regular hippos.","Hm. A confused hippos is already kind of bloodlusted though. Does it retain the same personality, trusts, and memories as the dog? I think either way it'll be bad, but humanity for sure survives. There's a very narrow range of Earth where hippos can thrive. Ecosystems will be a bit fucked until winter comes and kills them all off. Although, given how well they're doing \in Columbia\ it's likely they'll stick around anywhere the climate allows."
argumenta sobre: Wolverine Marvel vs Katana Man Chainsaw Man Round 1: no prep time Round 2: 24 hours of prep time Round 3: bloodlusted and enraged,"Gonna go with Wolverine here. Katana Man's specialty of blitzing his opponent won't be of use here when said opponent can regenerate without needing blood, and has nigh-indestructible bones so he can't even slice him to pieces. Unlike him, Katana Man can't really afford to get hit even with his regen, cause he needs the blood for it. So it's game over if he's decapitated, bisected or his limbs are lopped off. He doesn't even seem all that fast outside of his special move considering how well Aki performed against him. I don't think the prep time will be of any use here. I can envision Wolverine doing more with it since he's more cunning and experienced. But I don't recall him doing anything special with extra time to prepare."

How would the coalition of the necron dynasties working together in the modern setting do against this group? Edit: Necrons aren't allowed to reform shards into a full C'tan or anything like that. Explicitly not using the war in heaven version. GE can be canon or legends, they're often directly compared to the Imperium so I figured this would be fun.","So basically, the t'au get two forms of FTL that don't suck, a bunch of forerunner tech, and a galaxies worth of resources. Maybe if they had like a few centuries to build up that territory and expand their fleets they'd give a fair fight, but with no prep time they just lose, the tau and covenant do have some pretty powerful weaponry but they can't field the numbers necessary to fight the necrons. The empire isn't really worth much other than the resources and planet cracking tech they bring to the table"

Plankton has only rarely turned his true genius towards accomplishing that. I'm pretty sure the whole restaurant is just an extension of his desire to one-up Krabs. The real limiting factor is that Plankton is unlikely to quit his supervillian bullshit just because Ramsey is around trying to fix his business. Plankton will wind up doing something outside the realm of the restaurant proper that results in the police hauling him off or the heroes kicking his crap in. This is only going to be accelerated by the fact that Ramsey is filming everything and will get Plankton's ranting on camera. It's not a question of ""can Ramsey fix the business,"" it's a question of ""can he fix the core problem of the business being owned by a supervillian who only superficially cares about the success of the business."""

"argumenta sobre: Rational Man with a Shotgun vs Rational Man with a Home Depot Rational Man with a Home Depot is inside an abandoned but fully stocked Home Depot and gets 24 hours to prepare using anything one might reasonably expect to find in a Home Depot. He has no internet access or helpers, but he must find a way to defend himself. After 24 hours are up, Rational Man with a Shotgun enters the Home Depot and attempts to hunt down RMwaHD. RMwaHD has basic adult competency with the tools available to him, but has no specific scientific, carpentry, or engineering training. RMwaS gets one fully loaded pump shotgun, but no additional shells, so only 10 rounds. Once the fight starts, neither may leave the store. Fight is to death or incapacitation. Round 1: Prompt as stated Round 2: RMwaHD gets access to an internet enabled smartphone. RMwaS carries infinite ammo, but must reload after every 10 rounds fired. Round 3: RMwaHD gets access to an internet enabled smartphone and a store employee who is familiar with the store and can do things like fetch items and assist with rote construction tasks but must leave before the fight starts. RMwaS gets infinite ammo and police-level body armor Bonus: As round 3, but RMwaHD now has the composite engineering and scientific knowledge of Walter White and Jamie Hyneman. RMwaS now additionally gets his choice of any civilian-grade small arms and a full set of riot gear. Bonus 2: Since we seem to have reached a consensus that RMwaHD has a huge advantage here. How many of the bonus round version RMwaS would it take to 5/10 or better RMwaHD?","Without a time limit this could go on until one of them gets too dehydrated or otherwise exhausted. An HD is large, easy to hide in, and complicated with few open area, and while there are ways for the RMwaHD to defeat RMwaSG, all of them are risky and this man is rational. Assuming neither can leave, this becomes a war of deadly hide and seek. There isn't much food in a HD some snacks at the front but there's running water and probably something that can be used as a water bottle. I feel like if these men are truly rational, this fight is a lot more boring than you might think."

"argumenta sobre: Who would win between the entire world population of crows and the city of New York? So sources estimate 27 million crows in the world and rising The population of New York City is about 8.09m as of this year. Take away any outside forces, only the people within the city. The crows are aggro to every human but don't act anymore violent than regular crows. They're just pissed at every person in the whole city.","Based on the US Census data around 3.8 million New Yorkers would be adults within the 18-50 age range. Let's take another 10% off to account for the disabled and the sick, and that leaves us with 3.5 million people against 27 million crows. So every able-bodied adult has to fight off 7-8 crows on average. I'd say in a life-or-death situation, most adult humans can cripple or kill that number of crows without sustaining life threatening injuries themselves. And that is before taking into account that someone like a riot police would practically be immune to any and all crow attacks, so they can kill an inordinate amount just by themselves. I think the humans have this."

Yes, they can throw them. Round 2: The men have shotguns, with infinite ammo as well, but the Beetle has a Porsche Boxter frame and engine and spikes on the front. Round 3: The Beetle is Bumblebee Bumblebee Movie, and the men have rocket launchers.","Round 1 and 2 are humans 10/10. Cars are actually kinda fragile. One good shot to the grill will damage the radiator and cause it to leak coolant, which will eventually kill the engine. Even successfully running over one of the humans would probably damage the oil pan, which will eventually kill the engine, on a car that low. All the humans have to do is cause a leak then play keep away using the lamps until the car dies. Actually, unless the car has infinite gas, they can just climb the lamps and wait for the car to run out of gas. Round 3 Idk enough Bumblebee feats to say for sure but he probably takes it.

The 11-year-old girl is a Muggle-born witch whose parents work for the government. Hagrid is permitted to use any means he considers necessary to accomplish the mission. Can he do it?,"Yes. Most of NK's defense grid is oriented at the threats presented by SK, the U.S., Japan and the U.N., not a big burly dude on an itty bitty bike. His radar cross section would be small and irregular, and his thermal borderline nil, so even if they did spot him in the air they'd be hard pressed to engage. Early Hagrid before having his name cleared has the handicap of not having a fully working wand, but could still use magical devices like the deluminator, hand of glory, etc to both cover is entry and exit and avoid the attention of the parents. Speaking the language might be a problem I don't recall if HP has ""universal translator"" magic, but he could cheat that with a Pensive and a memory of someone who spoke fluent Korean delivering the sales pitch for Hogwarts. Late Hagrid after he gets his name cleared for the Moaning Myrtle incident has all that and actual magic.

They can still die from hitting the ground if their wings are damaged enough.most damage can quickly stack up due to their wings being a membrane like structure Any military assault rifle round to the head sustained for a second or two will reliably kill them within short order due to them having an insane amount of blood vessels there to take the heat from fire away from the brain.

"argumenta sobre: The army of Mordor took a wrong turn and goes up against the Roman Empire at its height.. Their army camps in Germania their base of operations and prepares to annihilate all human kind. We assume the barbarians Franks, Germans have been wiped out or have fled to Rome. Rome responds by sending its entire army to face off against the enemy. It is currently 117AD under Trajan's reign. Rome has scouted at their foe and deduce that Trolls, mumakil, goblins, orcs, wargs and so on are killable yet are obviously still terrifying and foreign. The battle takes place on a flat land in Northern Italy. Both armies being everything they can muster. Rome has amassed every professional soldier in the empire no sudden influx of recruits due to drafting Round 1: No retreat, the winner of this battle conquers. Round 2: Rome can fall back and use attrition and fortifications. The army of Mordor needs supplies to feed its army. Round 3: Julius Caesar leads the Roman army, Sauron without the ring leads Mordor. Edit: This really blew up and I saw a lot of great comments and points on both sides. Fucking awesome everyone : Edit 2: shit we made it near the top spot.. Can we push through? Oh, as for my opinion.. Rome takes it baby ; Legionaries smash orcish mobs all day Edit III: I wanna thank everyone who made a point and joined this epic discussion.. 700+ comments as of right now! It seems like Rome has this taken.. But not for lack of Mordor trying. Maybe if I have time I'll count up every vote and see what thinks : thanks again guys and gals","I believe people are seriously underestimating the Roman legions. First, let us talk about the size of the Roman Army under Trajan. The largest number I can find for the orcs is 250k at Pellanor Fields. This represented the vast bulk of Sauron's strength, if memory serves. The Roman Legions under Trajan are estimated to be around 350-400k. Keep in mind that a large majority of these troops are battle-hardened career soldiers. While there may be initial shock value in the first engagement, the hallmarks of the Romans were adapting their tactics to suit their enemies. The Romans developed sophisticated methods to deal with war elephants, for example. It is unreasonable to assume they would not do the same for Mumakil etc. Keep in mind that Mumakil where effectively routed by a force of 6,000 Rohirrim cavalry. To say that the Romans are not capable of the same with their already established superior number is ludicrous. As to the orcs themselves, they are usually portrayed as generally being inferior to men in their fighting abilities. They have less morale, fighting skills, and arguably worse equipment then then the Romans. They lack the discipline, unit cohesion, and fighting experiences of the Romans. While Mordor would be able to make initial strides with what I would consider specialized shock troops, they would soon be cut off and surrounded as Mordor's basic line infantry falls to legionnaires. Keep in mind the martial mentality of the Romans, these are the people who lost an estimated 50-70k men at the battle of Cannae. To put that in perspective, the Romans took as many causalities in ONE DAY as the United States took in the ENTIRE VIETNAM WAR. Further consider population levels at the time: loosing 60k men when the entire population of Rome was around 400k was an enormous loss. This is also not counting the casualties they had already sustained from Trebia and Trasmine which approximates to around an additional 40k losses. Even after sustaining these horrendous loses against arguably the greatest general in history, the Romans absolutely refused to surrender. They went so far as to outlaw grieving in the city itself. After these setbacks, the Romans adapted their tactics weird! and continued fighting for another 10 years before finally claiming victory. This should give a small glimpse into the absolute single-mindedness of the Romans--they will not be intimidated, they will not back down, and they will not cut and run. You will have to kill each and every single one of them to defeat them. Ok, that last sentence was a bit of hyperbole, but you get the point. So before this gets any longer: 1. Unless Mordor can effectively disorganize and completely rout the Roman army in the opening engagement of the battle, they will be outmaneuvered and defeated. 2. Without the prospect of a decisive battle to thoroughly defeat the Romans, this is even worse for Mordor, again they are defeated. 3. While Sauron's presence greatly enhances the capabilities of Mordor, if he does not have the ring, the Romans still win. Albeit with significantly greater casualties. Ninja edit: also people, think about how Mordor has to advance through the fire OF THE ENTIRE ROMAN ARTILLERY CORPS. Think of the beginning of Gladiator, now multiply that by a thousand. Edit: I figured I would hop back in and address some points that people brought up. The reason I left the Nazgul out is due to their small numbers. While yes they would undoubtedly cause hundreds if not thousands of Romans to flee, there are only 9 of them. Their numbers are far too small to affect the outcome of a battle involving perhaps 1 million plus combatants. In fact, in some regards the Witch King is wasted as a combat asset. He is of far more value actually commanding the armies of Mordor than as a combatant. As to the points of the nine attacking the Roman artillery positions, while this sounds good in theory, in application it has major issues. 1. The numbers they are attacking. There is only 9 of them, and while they may be extremely difficult to kill, the felbeasts are not, relatively speaking. You cannot logically say that felbeasts will survive tens of thousands of archers, scorpions, and ballistas shooting at them. 2. Assuming that they survive the fall from the felbeasts, they are now cut off and surrounded by literally the entire Roman army. They will kill dozens, hundreds, hell, maybe thousands, but eventually Pullo will throw a pilum through the back of the Witch King's hood, or he will catch a ballista bolt to the chest. 3. Even if they couldn't be killed, do you understand how large a battlefield this is going to be? One side of the army will have no hope of even seeing the other side, let alone the middle. In the amount of time it will take them to walk around and kill everyone, the battle will be long over. Mumakil: these are honestly the best hope Mordor has of winning, but they still have a number of critical weaknesses that I think the Romans would be all too happy to exploit. 1. The Romans don't need to kill the Mumakil--they just need to panic them. In fact this was one of the primary strategies the Romans employed against actual war elephants. Someone may correct me if I'm wrong, but is not this essentially what the Men of the West do in the battle of the Pelanor fields? 2. The Mumakil are extremely tough, but the riders are vulnerable to a shot from an arrow, balista, or scorpion. The Romans will no doubt seek to exploit this. 3. An extremely good historical point was made below that the use of catapult on the battlefield was not exactly a thing until the Mongolians pioneered it. However, we must consider that the entire Roman army is here, which means all of their siege equipment. When Flavius Flave sees the giant building-size elephants bearing down on them and he has a onager that can hurl massive stones designed to crush city walls, or pots filled with combustible liquids tell me one of those on the face of an Mumakil would not panic it, is it that hard of a logical leap to make that he might decide to use them on the Mumakil? Even then, I have a hard time imagining a ballista bolt could not pierce the hide of a Mumakil. Remember, necessity is the mother of invention. People seem to not know what I mean when I reference elite shock units. From the historical perspective these where units designed to cause overwhelming casualties and morale ""damage"" by executing devastating charges into infantry formations. Historical units that fit this classification are: Cataphracts: Scythed Chariots Syrian or Africa Forest War Elephants: War Dogs The point is that most of the elite units of Mordor armored trolls, Mumakil, and Nazgull fit this exact description hence why I referred to them as elite shock troops. Their power lies in their initial charge as it breaks up formations and causes panic. This is perhaps the number one thing that Roman Legionaries drilled to prevent. Desertion or running from battle was punished by being beaten to death with clubs by the men of your own unit that you put in danger. I am not saying that Legionaries could not be broken or forced to rout--far from it--but to assume that it would be ""easy"" is a gross underestimation of Roman training and military tactics. Orc canon fodder tactics are common throughout the books, in fact, I don't think there is a single case where the Men of the West outnumber their enemies in the entire series. Orc strategy usually involves overwhelming the enemy through sheer numbers. Even if we are to assume that Mordor has a 2-1 advantage, which I believe it has been thoroughly established that they do not, then this is not nearly enough to adopt this kind of strategy. Also keep in mind when armies get this large they cannot all possibly fight at the same time, as there is so many people there is just simply not enough room. This means that while the front lines are fighting the legionaries, the back is constantly being shot to shit by archers etc. The initial orc forces are also going have to deal with the largest pilum what would be the proper pluralization of this? volley in history. Pilum: OK. I finally think that is it. As I said before, if Mordor can break the Legions in the opening engagement of the battle, they can win. I think they have virtually no chance of pulling this off. I am not saying that Rome will not take heavy or even extraordinarily heavy casualties, but the historical records shows that taking massive casualties, usually causes the Romans to fight harder not surrender or rout. The Romans also have war pigs, nuff said. edit: I actually went back and did some proofreading. I apologize for any eyeballs that people may have lost. edit: last edit I swear, since this post has become so popular, I feel obliged to point out there are some historical inaccuracies in how I have the Legions fight. 1. Firstly, field artillery was not really a thing around the time of the Romans. Considering the circumstances of OP's scenario, I simply felt that it was logical that the Romans would use them instead of just leaving them to acquire dust. 2. Gladiator is a very historically inaccurate movie. The way the Germanic Barbarians are portrayed for example is laughably inaccurate, also Legionary helmets. 3. Since I was intoxicated when I initially composed this post, I counted the Roman Legion's as consisting of only Roman Legionaries. In reality about half of the strength of the Legions where comprised of Auxilia units. 4. Also, I am sorry, Flavius Flave is a highly fashionable Roman of my own making. Information on the Auxilia for those who desire it: I have been gifted internet Aurum! Thank you kind Senators!"

"argumenta sobre: European Settlers Vs DnD High Elves So inspired by post and because said I should I'm going to re-try this challenge and make it a bit clearer so yall can't kill the thread XD The challenge is simple: The European settlers Britain, France etc must successfully establish settlements on the eastern seaboard of what is now the US and defend themselves against the now Elvish native population Settler win conditions: Minor; Successfully create and defend their settlements Major: Successfully push westwards, successfully establishing and defending these western settlements Final: Genociding the elves Native/Elves win conditions: Minor; successfully block any westward expansion, locking the settlers in to only their eastern seaboard settlements Major; driving the settlers completely out of the US and clearing all their settlements Final: The Elves not only drive out the Settlers but successfully stop any future attempts at settling Caveat's: All elves can cast magic, classes aren't a thing, and all elves can cast magic up to the fourth level using DnD 5e spell lists and have the maximum amount of spell slots/spell points/whatever alternate casting thing Wizards fancies making they can have at that level Elves have access to material components alternatively they can create arcane focuses from regular materials as they can in DnD The Elves are High Elves with their racial bonuses etc The Settlers are from various European countries but they can all communicate easily and are willing to work together, unite and won't fight amongst themselves and have the best weapons available at the time of the American settlement Neither side can surrender or flee but moral can affect individual soldiers/units, it won't make them flee but will affect their combat effectiveness The Elves can die to wounds that would kill a human, so without magical healing, they will die just the same as normal people; wounds to major organs, bleeding out etc The elves are partly immune to diseases and illnesses brought by the settlers, they won't wipe out the elves but they can cause some damage The Elves are split into different tribes but are willing to unite to face the outside threat Settlers get reinforcements as long as they have one settlement still in their control to act as a landing zone I'm not really expecting the Settlers to win , at least not their higher victory options, but I'm curious to see how well people think they will do, what strategies they can use to gain a foothold etc Edit: just try and make it a little more fair, all the settlers can reload really quickly, to help increase fire rate Fun/silly addition: this can be ignored but just a fun little change the settlers have access to weapons commonly associated with the Western period/Cow boys such as the Winchester 1873 Edit 2: thread killers will be given to Shovel for her amusement","I'll talk about the spells. I think this is really easy with up to 4th level spells. Invisibility, Disguise self, and Suggestion could all wreak havoc as you impersonate and magically compel the leaders/captainsor crewmates. Poisoning enemy supplies would be easy. Guerilla warfare would also be incredibly strong with magic. Invisibility, Pass without trace, and or just sneaking to get into position, and the right spell could kill a camp. Here are more spells I think would be very impactful, but is by no means exhaustive: Offensive: fireball, shatter, Hail of thorns, magic missile, sleep, enemies abound, conjure animals, Conjure woodland beings, Hunger of hadar, spirit guardians, all the other summon demon/fey spells, tidal wave, Fireball will kill everyone in a 20 foot radius, can be cast multiple times, and can probably burn the ships down. Conjure animals and woodland beings could wreak havoc too, especially choosing pixies which have more magic. Hunger of Hadar could be used at a chokepoint to make it impossible to cross without dying. Defensive: silvery barbs, shield, silent image, mage armor, Mirror Image, Leo's tiny hut Utility: Find familiar, speak with animals / beast bond, minor illusion, unseen servant, Augury, Calm emotions, Darkness, Detect thoughts, Silence, Polymorph, Leos tiny hut, Major Image, Plant growth, Revivify, Speak with dead, dimension door, Greater invisibility, Polymorph is offensive, defensive, and utility for sneaking as well. Leos tiny hut means they cant be ambushed while sleeping, can sleep anywhere, and you can even attack from it and they have no counter besides running away Major Image, they could conjure their God to tell them to never come back Healing: good berry From this list, the elves will have the ability to layer magical defenses on themselves, cast AOE attacks that all kill at a range of up to 120 feet, sneak into any position easily, turn the enemies into betraying eachother, create illusions and the ability to hide, ask god if their plans are a good idea, and change or abandon plans that won't work out well, magically calm the humans, obscure areas, silence areas, read their minds, and pretty much heal anyone. Goodberries mean they don't have to worry about food and could just burn all the supplies and farms.

"argumenta sobre: Who wins WWIII? No nukes With the various armed conflicts going on Russia vs. Ukraine, Pakistan vs. India, and Israel vs. Palestine & Iran, it feels like we're in the runup to WWIII similar to what was happening in the 1930s. My coping mechanism has been to try to understand what would happen if things did escalate to that point. So, here is a map I assembled of how I think the chips might fall with my novice understanding of current events and geopolitics. Let's assume mutually assured destruction keeps the WMD's out of the conflict. Scenario 1: The USA reverses its course towards authoritarianism and falls back in line with the other Western countries most likely, IMO. 1A With President Trump still in office, where he caves to internal pressure from protests and external pressure from the EU and Canada, and/or is aligned by a worsening relationship with China. 1B With President Trump out of office, either by forced removal or by election in 2028 Scenario 2: The mask comes off and President Trump aligns himself with Russia and then China by default. This assumes that civil unrest in the USA is at least partially quelled, enough that the military still takes orders from the Commander in Chief and is able to have an expeditionary force. In terms of armed conflict, this scenario looks pretty lopsided toward the Axis, so the question is just as much about if this could really happen. Who would win? For a longer read -- my rationale for the alliance and goals of a few of the bigger / more active players: Axis: USA if Axis: Annexation of Canada and Greenland, control of Panama Canal. Long term view: control of trade routes and freshwater resources. Russia: Annexation of Ukraine, Georgia, and the Baltics. Long term view: control of Europe. China: Annexation/established control of Taiwan and Hong Kong, destabilization of the West and Japan. Long term view: control of South Asia and Africa. Pakistan: Annexation of contested regions of India. Long term view: destruction of India Iran/Egypt/Etc. in the Middle East: Destruction of Israel. Long term view: Caliphate? Sunni/Shi'a conflict not resolved. Saudi Arabia drops the facade and joins its neighbors. South East Asia: Recruited by China as buffe against India and Australia Turkiye: Muslim solidarity, buffer against EU. South Africa: BRICS solidarity, control shipping around the cape. NOTE: this and the Muslim bloc's control of Suez could force Panama into play as the last viable East/West naval route. Brazil, Bolivia, and Uruguay: proxy war to gain control of Panama. Venezuela: Opportunistic annexation of contested Guyanese oil resources North Korea: Opportunistic reunification of Korea Allies: USA if Allied, Canada, EU and Nordics: Defense of Ukraine, Baltics, Georgia, Israel, India, and the Panama Canal. If Axis USA: Defense of Greenland & Canada, Iceland also pulled in as staging point. India: Annexation of contested regions of Pakistan. Long Term view: Destabilize China and Muslim Bloc to become eminent Asian superpower. Australia, NZ, Japan, & Oceania: Recruited by USA and EU to defend Taiwan/HK and divide China's attention from India and Russia's attention from Europe. South Korea: Defend against North Korea. Long Term view: Counterattack and reunification of Korea. Israel: Annexation of Palestine and defense against Muslim Bloc. Long Term view: potential control over Sinai Peninsula and Suez Canal? Argentina & Paraguay: Proxy war to divide Brazil's attention from Panama Columbia: Proxy war to provide buffer for Panama and divide Venezuela's attention from Guyana Wildcard: Bangladesh. Among South Asia: 2nd largest economy, 3rd largest army. Could turn the tide on the Asian front. Reasons to join Axis: They have a defense agreement with China and they have the 3rd largest Muslim population in the world Muslim solidarity. Reasons to join Allies: They conduct joint military exercises with India, they are part of the UN largest contributor of UN peacekeeping forces. and they have a history of conflict with Pakistan. Reasons to stay neutral: They recently 2024 overthrew their government and the instability could descend into civil war if they take one side or the other. Notable Neutrals: Switzerland, as usual Nepal & Bhutan: Could be deemed not worth the cost in mountainous terrain. Might side with India anyway. Africa besides Egypt & South Africa, plus Yemen & Oman: focusing on their own issues. Proxy wars could develop, with Libya and Somalia joining the Axis and Ethiopia and Kenya joining the Allies. UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, & Kuwait: Insulated by the rest of the Muslim Bloc. Let the dust settle and see if Western relations can be maintained in an Allied victory, or go with the tide in an Axis victory. Mexico & Central America: If Axis USA, don't poke the bear and let them focus north. If Allied USA, focusing on their own issues. Eurasian Steppes: insulated from the front line. Soft alliance with Axis powers. Non-EU Balkans: Yea I'm not touching that. Pacific South America: Don't cross the mountains and there won't be a problem.","US has the largest air force in the world The US also has the 2nd largest air force in the world the navy planes.

Similar to my post about the USSR fighting Nazi Germany without Western aid, could the United States, Great Britain, and France have defeated Nazi Germany if the Germans hadn't broken their nonaggression pact with the Soviets and we assume the reverse doesn't happen either?","Yes. They invaded the USSR because they had begun to rapidly deplete their oil and fuel resources. They were losing more combat aircraft over the English Channel than they could replace. They would have eventually weakened to the point where Stalin would have seen an opportunity to break peacetime formation and possibly strike first. It would have taken longer and nukes would have landed on Germany, but the Axis blew its load attempting to take Britain and support a mechanized war machine that they didn't have the logistics to sustain on their own - especially without properly trained soldiers many were conscripts and impressed into service from other countries that they annexed."

In this battle Traumerei is not immortal, since sung jin-woo would be irregular And no over-scaling sung jin-woo, he has never shown feet that shows him anywhere from continental to maximum planetary, if you want to go to the maximum power","Jin-Woo probably takes it. Traumerei's got absurd hax with the anima control and sheer authority over countless beasts, but Solo Leveling leans harder into brute force scaling + resurrection spam + broken versatility. Jin-Woo doesn't just summon….he is the system. His shadows don't stay down unless he does, and the moment one of Traumerei's summons falls, Jin-Woo turns it. Even if Traumerei's beasts regen while he lives, Jin-Woo's regen is cracked too, and his summons do evolve mid-fight. Add in Kamish, Beru, Igris, Bellion and the dude himself who can blink around and chop up high-level threats solo - he's built for sustained overwhelming force. Unless Traumerei pulls some sleeper mindhax or metaphysical soul-wipe that bypasses the system entirely, he's just gonna get attritioned out."

It's honestly less effective than a large herbivore given its weapons. It's suited for killing other large animals. A Triceratops would be better since it's basically an Elephant with better armor. Give it some eye protection so someone can't just put a spear into them. It's got enough room for a nice howda on top for some archers/slingers plus the handlers.

If he guesses it, you lose the power and you have to fight him barehanded. What power can let you win? Rules: - Batman/Bruce will simply be in his underwear with no weapons or armor. You can wear your regular street clothes if you like. - To avoid him instantly speedblitzing you, you start at opposite ends of a football field. - He can ask any question he wants, and will be doing his best to whittle down entire categories by asking things like ""will it let you hit me from a distance?"" or ""will it affect my ability to perceive you?"" or ""if a 10-year old had this power, is there a reasonable chance that YOU could beat him?"". - He gets 3 minutes to prepare a strategy before asking the first question, then 30 seconds after your answers to ask each additional question. - His guess needs to be pretty close, but it doesn't have to be exact. He needs to have the basic ideas behind your powers down, but doesn't need to have the exact incidental details. If you choose ""Spawning 143 northeastern bald faced hornets per second out of my left hand"" as your power, and he guesses that you can summon or generate stinging insects, that's a win for him. - If he doesn't get your power within 20 guesses, his memory of the conversation will be erased to keep him from deducing which powers you do or don't have, and all he'll know is that he needs to incapacitate you. - Should go without saying, but you have to answer honestly.

"argumenta sobre: Harry Potter, but everyone tells Harry the truth from the beginning. 1. As soon as he's able to understand it, Petunia and Vernon tells Harry about how his parents died and of the magic world, as much as they know about it anyway. They let Harry express his magic without restrictions. 2. A few years later, Dumbledore himself visits Harry, tells him about Hogwarts, about Voldemort, Sirius Black, Harry's mother's sacrifice, and whatever he knows about horrokruxes at the time. 3. At age 11, Harry is accepted at Hogwarts. Hagrid helps him with everything just as in the first book. When asked about the philosopher's stone, Hagrid explains everything he knows about it. He meets Hermione and Ron in an ordinary fashion. 4. When arriving at Hogwarts he meets Dumbledore again, who explains everything he knows again, just to be sure. He also tells Harry about Snape. 5. When the event of the third book occurs, Lupin tells Harry about him being a werewolf at their first patronus class. When shown the Marauder's Map, he tells Harry about Sirius, James Potter, Wormtail and of how Wormtail betrayed them. Also about how a grown ass man has lived in Ron's room for a century. 6. When Dumbledore learns something new about the Horrocruxes, he immediately tells Harry. 7. Dumbledore is killed by Snape, but Dumbledore and Snape have had a conversation with Harry about it earlier. If I missed any crucial point somewhere, the premise here is that no one lies to Harry about anything and tells him about everything they know of importance, as soon as they can. Can he still defeat Voldemort in the end?","Unlikely because there are reasons he wasn't told, particularly as the books go on. Voldemort was both watching Harry and had inside info through their connection. If Voldemort catches on to the plan early, he has more time to react and respond to Dumbledores plan. Realistically Harry won through a confluence of luck and timing, without which even his best efforts wouldn't have succeeded. Remember that Harry never really beats Voldemort in any kind of a fight. He gets lucky and escapes, and otherwise Voldemort defeats himself due to his arrogance and not understanding Dumbledores plan. Giving Voldemort any breadcrumbs at all spells doom to Harry and Dumbledore. And the more Harry knows, the more he does."

Both can parlay with foreign governments. One must wipe out each other. Who comes out on top? Grant or Washington?","Grant would have better understanding of modern military weapons and tactics. George Washington on the other hand was a fantastic leader but not all that great of a strategist. Neither side has much relevant military experience. Grant would grasp modern warfare a tiny bit better but not in any ways that matter. They would probably both just relinquish most decision making responsibility to their generals and commanders. Assuming their underlings are equal I'd say the win goes to George just due to the morale boost of being led by the big G and from Washington's charisma. If they have to command the troops themselves I imagine Grant would win as his military experience is slightly more relevant. Semi-auto rifles, attack copter cavalry, artillery bombardment etc would be a bit easier for Grant to grasp. tl;dr George wins the popularity contest but Grant would be a much better commander."

We know a runabout's shields can survive hits from dangerous ships Jem'Hadar attack ships in particular, so I don't think railguns and PDCs would do anything at all, and they move so much faster than any ship in The Expanse so I don't see how a nuclear torpedo could ever hit it they could just warp away for a second anyway if one was locked on.

I personally don't think this changes until book 7-9 spoilers... >!the Magnetar-class comes onto the scene, and even then who the heck knows. Its main gun is so weird who knows what would happen if that and shields interacted. !< Edit: Danube-class runabout, to be clear, technically runabout is a generic term.","ST is a very high tier series focused on space combat, their shuttles are absurd. The shields are literally supposed to deflect away anything like a mass driver round, regardless of speed/power, without really affecting anything. The torpedos aren't going to manage the speeds the ship can, and if they could the phasers are more than capable of just destroying all of them. Worse, ST phasers can fire at light second ranges, while most of the weapons in the expanse have effective ranges into the thousands of kilometers. So ON TOP of the fact that if they could get in range they couldn't hurt the runabout... the runabout can detect them at absurd range and destroy them before they even approach weapon range.

"argumenta sobre: Vietnam right after unification,1975? Replaces past Vietnam in the year 1720. So 1975 Vietnam right after the Vietnam war vs 1720s east asia. Qing, japan. I'm not familiar with east asian history. This is my first who would win post. Could they conquer the rest of east asia/Sinosphere","They could conquer Qing China or at least do so much damage to the point it collapses, Japan is harder because of the need for a naval invasion and the fact they have the potential to equip most of their army with firearms the Qing from what I remember only had 40% of their army equipped with firearms during the First Opium War and that was 100+ years later than 1720 and the crappy terrain, but it's still doable if they were really that determined. There's obviously going to be logistical issues but there's really not much the Qing can do instead of delaying the inevitable. Now if this was a can they keep their gains question instead of only conquest then keeping it would be a different story, they don't have the industry to keep producing Cold War era military equipment and now they have so many regions to keep under their control, but conquest wise I think they can at the very least conquer China, it has been accomplished before by foes who had comparable technology to the Chinese."

"argumenta sobre: People of Manhattan see a large health bar forming in the sky; it reads 'The Wither'. How much damage can the Wither Minecraft do to Manhattan before it's killed? Inspired by this thread awhile back. Some meticulous and devious reality warping Minecraft player managed to bring a Wither from Minecraft into the real world. The Wither starts 20 feet above the middle of pre-COVID 19 Times Square exactly at noon on a Monday, ready to cause as much destruction to the city. Wither Gameplay example Wiki Sadly no respect thread yet. Rules: No prep time for both the Wither or the borough, unless stated otherwise. A large number of people in Manhattan will have previous knowledge of the Wither. New York and the U.S. government can consult experts and sources when the Wither is spawned. Rounds: Round 1: The Wither immediately spawns in Times Square. Round 2: The Wither takes 5 minutes to fully spawn, therefore Manhattan will have 5 minutes of prep. Round 3: Same as round 1 but there are now two Withers. Round 4: Same as round 2 but there are now three Withers.","I think people are discounting the amount of pandemonium it would cause. Mass hysteria as our whole worldview is upended would cause major damage to the city all by itself. The fact that guns will take it to half health but no lower is almost worse. I don't know what percentage of Times Square pedestrians are armed at any given moment probably not many, or what percentage of those will start squeezing off shots rather than running in terror harder to estimate, but I would expect some small arms fire in the first couple minutes. When people see the health bar start to drop, within a few more minutes there'll be a LOT of personal firearms being discharged by people who probably have very little idea what's going on and are freaked out and surging with adrenaline. A lot of bullets are going to go a lot of places. Eventually artillery gets there and will finish the job. Someone better informed than me might be able to estimate how long it would take for the military to mobilize, but with the implausible reports coming in, that might take a bit longer than expected. And explosives are likely to cause their own collateral damage too, especially if they start dropping bombs. All told... for R1 I'd wager near complete destruction of a few city blocks, and mayhem causing millions of dollars in damage throughout the rest of the city. The other rounds don't change much except getting the military there five minutes earlier, which will mitigate some of the damage."

"argumenta sobre: Someone is set back to America on July 4, 1776. They have to be elected president of the United States before 2025. Can it be done? The person being set back in time is a 50-year-old, straight male of European ancestry from the Midwest called James. He will remain perpetually 50-years-old till 2025. However, no one really seems to notice or cares that James doesn't seem to age, or that disease and injury don't seem to affect him all that much. James is also unable to use the fact that he can't age or die for political purposes, because people for some reason don't seem to be particularly impressed by immortality in this scenario. What James can do however, is use knowledge about the future to his advantage. This can include world history events or even medical and technological knowledge. But that doesn't necessarily mean people will believe him. There is also very minimal butterfly effect at play, so it's not like WW2 never happens for example. Over time, James can learn to improve his political savviness, build political capital, accumulate personal financial wealth etc. Some additional information about James. He is a practicing lawyer who runs his own semi-successful law firm. He has a family of four. He is a lukewarm Lutheran, and a self-described ""centrist"". But that doesn't mean he isn't willing to change his political beliefs to achieve the highest office in the land. James has no military experience. Can James ever become POTUS?

By the time the Russians led by General Roman Barkov invade Urzikstan 9 years later, Al-Qatala has been transformed into an actual army thanks to Perseus' support. Now that Al-Qatala has undergone a significant upgrade in weaponry and equipment, can they beat both the Russian invasion force AND destroy the Urzikstan Liberation Force at the same time? Objectives: This is a free-for-all.

That said I'm only assuming that Perseus don't have an Air Force. If they do I think their alliance with Al-Qatala will win by attrition and subterfuge.

"argumenta sobre: Can Walter White prevent his son's new BFF Peter Parker from interrupting his drug empire? The timeline is very early Season Three of Breaking Bad. This is MCU Peter Parker circa Spider-Man: Homecoming. Walter White is conducting his criminal activities, having to deal with Jesse's mental spiral over Jane's recent death, the recent Wayfarer 515 plane crash, his wife having just found out about what he really does for a living, and a million other things, when his son Walter Jr aka Flynn introduces his mom and dad to his new friend, Peter Parker. Flynn's best friend Louis and Peter are taking part in a student exchange program for gifted students, Louis spending the rest of the school year at Midtown High in New York City, while Peter enjoys the joys of the golden west here in Albuquerque. Walter and Skyler put on a brave face for Flynn and his new friend, hiding the truth from both young men. Walter even takes a liking to Peter once he realizes how scientifically minded he his. One evening after coming back from Gus's superlab, Walt notices Peter sneaking back into Walter Jr's bedroom. Walt didn't believe it at first because Peter was moving so fast. Walter, as he often does, overthinks a lot about this, and over the next week makes a point to come home around the same time every night, and yep, Peter is always sneaking in and out of the house via Flynn's bedroom. This aligns with the recent activity of Gus's street dealers being webbed up by a mysterious assailant. Walt even asked Gus to procure some of the webbing for him, which Walt tries to study, but it always dissolves within an hour, making it difficult to do so. But the reality is obvious. Walt whispers a single, frightened word to himself: Spider-Man. Scenario 1: Walt tries various non violent ways to get Peter back home to Queens early. He is willing to use Saul, Gus, Mike, or whatever means necessary to make this happen. Scenario 2: Walt is willing to use violence, poisons, etc to stop Peter from interrupting Gus's and thus his business.

What would be the realistic reactions and thoughts to him and how far does he last in our world?,"The government discovers his identity in a week flat as he gets tracked to his home with satellite imagery and the like. Honestly, though, even when they can then threaten harm to Aunt May to get him to do what they want, he probably then just becomes an officially sanctioned hero. Not much reason to stop him doing what he's doing, as long as he stays in line; it's just good PR for the government. And he's probably willing to straight-up kill himself rather than be turned into a puppet assassin on foreign soil or what have you, so they can't really make him do anything truly bad. At most they might put him on the Secret Service once he's forced to explain how his Spidey Sense works; he's the best bodyguard possible."

However Rome fielded heavy infantry for a reason, and that reason is that most of Europe is hilly, wooded, rocky, or all three. The Mongols themselves had problems when they started to move into Eastern Europe. If the war took place on rougher ground with little forage i.e. most of Europe, the Romans could do quite well."

Yes, I am nerfing him, yes, it is unfair, I know, but we all know how this would go otherwise and that would be boring. Actually I will be nice and say really weak regen. If he gets his brain sploded rex style 😏, it takes a day to regen Hawkeye He doesn't really fit the tag the same way the others do, but I am curious They are all in random places. They are informed that they have to meet in a day and kill each other or they will all be killed. And for arguments sake, let's say Hawkeye decides to go along with it even though he is a hero. Anyway, in the day they can plan however they want, prepare, get weapons etc. They can't bring friends. Side note : Hawkeye has his Ronin sword as well Additionally, presume all the characters know nothing about each other. For me it goes something like this Dead shot and Hawkeye both go on different rooftops to snipe. Deadpool skips in smiling Deathstroke hangs back to assess everyone else Peacemaker just walks in and starts fighting Bloodsport and Deadpool who did the same. Peacemaker and Bloodsport die Deadpool is way more skilled. Deadpool is then headshotted by Deadshot and Hawkeye at the same time. By looking at the angles, they work out where each other are. Purely because pulling a trigger is faster than loading a bow I will say that Hawkeye dies. Sorry Hawkeye, I wanna glaze and say you win but I can't right now. Then, Deathstroke suits Deadshots neck as he has been behind him the moment he heard the gunshot. Taskmaster, realising Deathstroke is the last one makes his presence known. Taskmaster watched the whole time to learn how everyone fights and let the crowd thin out. Deathstroke is good but everything Deathstroke can do Taskmaster can do better. Taskmaster just manages to kill him, goes home and puts his feet up whilst watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S. At which point Deadpool shoots him because he has regenned by now. Deadpool wins in spite of the nerf I gave him lol, a bit of sneaky misdirection haha. Say what you would think would happen please","generally a KO counts as a loss even if the target is not ""dead"" for the purpose of the board. Otherwise some characters like Mr. Immortal, Granny Smite, or Immortal Hulk would never lose to anyone. I agree taskmaster generally takes this. Only Deadpool is capable of out-fighting him because his style is too unpredictable for Taskmaster to neutralize him using predictive MA but like Wolverine his style is ALSO very dependent on being able to soak hits with his healing factor. With a heavily nerfed version he's probably out of the fight pretty quickly. As for the rest, Taskmaster's standard loadout is simply too ridiculous for anyone else to deal with, combined with ""perfect aim"" stolen from Bullseye and that's all she wrote."

"argumenta sobre: HOW THE HELL can Bright Noa, Murrue Ramius and Sumeragi Lee Noriega on their best ships Gundam stop Grand Admiral Thrawn Star Wars Disney canon from reaching the inner Sol system? From three light-years beyond the Oort Cloud, the Seventh Fleet of the Galactic Empire has arrived to take over Sol. On Earth, a coalition of Gundam's commanders have anticipated their arrival, and are more than ready to launch a preemptive strike. Grand Admiral Thrawn has expressed his intent to destroy the United Earth Sphere Organization in a single stroke, having witnessed the limits of the most powerful mobile suits ever built. In response, Admiral Bright Noa and captains Murrue Ramius and Sumeragi Lee Noriega have issued demands of their own: bring the flagship Chimaera and sister ship Dark Omen between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, where negotiations are to be settled. Should talks break down, the coalition has secured all rights to shoot first. This is a single-scenario prompt. The UESO Gundam Coalition sets three goals: 1. Kill Grand Admiral Thrawn, and 2. destroy the Chimaera and Dark Omen in under 600 minutes, and 3. shock the rest of the Seventh Fleet into retreating after destroying the two Imperial Star Destroyers. The Gundam coalition shall field an initial vanguard of three ships, complemented by eight mobile suits per ship and one escort ship, inclusive of the pilots for each unit and all necessary staff. Prior to this engagement, all particle systems Minovsky, GN, and Mirage Colloid have been made constructively compatible through quantum stability calculations. The quantum artificial superintelligence Veda is also fully-available for all coalition assets, and safeguarded from any imperial breaching.

"argumenta sobre: Who can survive the center of a black hole 12000 times the size of the universe? Cyborg from DC comics claims he has a gun that can shoot ""One million decibels"" of white noise. While he's probably just exaggerating, it got me thinking about a scenario where it's not hyperbole, and this actually happens. One million decibels is an absolutely insane amount of energy, and this would likely result in the instantaneous creation of a supermassive black hole. I did some lets be real, probably wrong math and ended up with the size of this monstrosity: It would be 12,000 times bigger the size of the universe. It would have a gravitational force of 3589779570500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 metric tons It would be 1116000000000000 light years in diameter Is there any character in fiction that could survive this?

"argumenta sobre: If Zuko, Katara, and Toph were with Aang in the final battle, could Ozai have been defeated and subdued without the Avatar state? Inspired by this post The fight takes place in the same area as the final showdown between Aang and Ozai. Sozin's Comet is on. Aang has morals on, so isn't trying to kill. The other characters may try to kill if their code allows. Zuko will fight his father.","Ozai would focus on Zuko because he is fucking pissed. But he would remember that Zuko would redirect lightning, so he would have to use big blasts of flame. Zuko is also comet enhanced and with Dragon Dancing should be able to deflect his barrages for a bit. Toph is actually almost a liability here. Ozai can fly and that is primarily what he is doing, after whatever Toph's first move is, he will likely keep to the air and she will have little idea where he is. She should honestly just literally tunnel and try to launch suprise attacks when she can. Katara should stay near the waterfalls and ocean, so that she always has a large supply of water. She is even more outclassed than Zuko but she intercepted comet enhanced Azula's lightning with just water and she would have a bunch more here. Even if Ozai tries to dry up the area with big blasts, it will create steam that Katara can use to freeze him and slow him down at least or use the steam as cover while the other two/three attack. Also Aang is there. I think if all hunker around an area with a lot of water and Toph is nearby in a pillar of rock, they could beat him. But narratively Aang is going to be trying not to kill him and preventing others from doing so, that it will all fall apart and Ozai will all blast them probably non-lethally because it's Avatar and the same ol same ol will happen anyway."
"argumenta sobre: Which is the weakest modern military which can take over the world in 1500? The country really only has access to their population, so it cannot train soldiers from the people it conquers. Once a nation/kingdom is conquered, they no longer fight or contribute. The country can only use domestically produced arms some small inputs can be ignored.","Key here is: domestically produced arms! A helluva lot of the world doesnt produce their own armaments, from the smallest sidearm to the mightiest fighterjet! Now, China, USA and Russia are complete overkill. Brazil, too, just by number of people alone. Japan, South Korea, Germany, France and UK are natural contenders, but they, too, might be overkill. Italy, too, come to think about it. I propose Sweden. They either make everything they could need themselves, or could easily do so - they have the tech, the factories and all the steel they could ever ask for. Sure, they're not many, but once they can show that they can destroy anyone or anything at will, the rest of the world will either bend the knee or be destroyed."
argumenta sobre: 10 Protoss colossiStarcraft2 vs 500 M1 Abrams tanks The colossi are lore-based vs 500 modern M1 Abrams on a plain battlefield 500 meters apart.,"Colossi lore based would win. They have AI that coordinates better than tankers, and their plasma shields are strong and provide a significant advantage. Even if their shields get taken down, which is a big if, they are made from extremely durable minerals, meaning they will shrug off small arms and HE shots, and are resistant to any other. The only thing that poses a threat is APFSDS, but since Collosi are over 50m tall it would be like getting poked by a needle. The thermal lances are much more potent weapons than the Abrams main cannons, each swipe could disable dozens of tanks by melting their optics, if not outright destroy them in one go. If it is a close engagement the Abrams also lacks gun elevation angle to shoot the body of Collosi. The Collosi AI will likely exploit this fact and use the cover of their shields to close the distance. The sheer weight of Collosi could probably crush tens of Abrams underneath them."

Meaning they feel the same as humans in a fight. No powers. No one uppers. Just straight hands. Who wins? R1: Fist fight. R2: Grappling. R3: To the death. Someone must die.","R1: Without powers or transformations, Kratos is nearly double the mass of Goku. Have you seen those videos of smaller guys trying to fight bigger dudes? Edit: From estimates I found online. Goku is 175cm tall and weighs at best 90+ kg if we are generous on his most bulk forms. Kratos is 194 cm tall though some scripts and rigging show him at 213 cm and weighs about 110 kg at his lowest estimate, 129 at others. He is smaller on the Norse Games. On average I dare say a 30 kg difference. R2: Grappling is kind of THE Greek martial art. Wrestling is big on Greece as well as boxing. Goku has never shown any particular grappling talent while Kratos does stuff like slams, chokes, pinning, etc. R3: I think nearly all of Goku's kills except the Red Ribbon Army of Mooks were ki-based. Kratos is an expert on killing with his bare hands. And in terms of a number of battles he far outpaces Goku in experience killing. Goku spends most of his time training, not killing. The soldiers of Kratos' world are also expected to fight monsters even as regular humans, so their skills and brutality must be far more advanced than RL Greece. Goku's martial arts are great, but also dependant on ki and other superhuman abilities such as ki sensing, super reflexes, and flight to use at their best. He is adaptable though, as losing flight on the ToP was not that much of a problem, but he still needed ki to fight. He never really had to fight as a regular human and has been able to resist attacks from super beings that should've killed anyone else. Kratos has trained as a human well into adulthood and lost his powers many times. He is well aware of how to fight like that."
"argumenta sobre: Could Sheldon Cooper Produce 99.1% Pure Meth Like Walter White? Let's imagine a scenario where Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory is challenged to produce methamphetamine with the same 99.1% purity as Walter White from Breaking Bad. Sheldon has no prior experience in drug manufacturing but has a genius-level IQ, a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, and an eidetic memory. If given a reasonable time frame let's say a few months, could Sheldon learn enough about chemistry to match Walter White's 99.1% pure meth? Or does the lack of practical chemistry experience mean that no amount of theoretical knowledge would allow him to reach that level of purity? How do you think Sheldon would fare in this unconventional challenge?","Cooper is a physicist and routinely underestimates other disciplines. In the Breaking Bad universe, he simply can't do it. In the the Big Bang universe he initially laughs at the ease of the challenge, then there is an ""hilarious"" back-and-forth with Leonard who warns him that chemistry isn't trivial. Sheldon gets increasingly frustrated and snappish over the next of couple of days as he rapidly hits 97% but can't go over it. He gets the idea that he can crack it if he simply plugs away day and night and increases his caffeine intake to help. Soon he gets into a sleep-deprived delirium and decides to sample the product, which allows him to stop sleeping and rapidly get the purity to 99%. There are more ""hilarious"" scenes of methed-up Sheldon pinging around the apartment, to Leonard and Penny's increasing concern. Eventually Sheldon triumphantly shows Leonard a pile of sparkling blue meth with an astounding 99.2% purity, but it's revealed to be a dream sequence. The final part of the episode is Sheldon having to close the operation to avoid arrest. Credits roll with another ""hilarious"" dream sequence parodying the desert murders from Breaking Bad, with Sheldon as WW, Leonard as Hank, Howard as Gomey and Kripke as Jack the Chief Nazi."

Yoda's target = Luke ROTJ; Palpatine's = Vader ESB R3: Yoda and Palpatine are allowed to bring in one individual to help turn their respective targets.

To show force sensitives times when more power, less restraint, and more domination of the dangerous other would help them.

argumenta sobre: 2000000 Star Wars' Acklay has attacked the coast of France and Spain. Will the armies of both countries be able to defeat it? They will rise from the Atlantic Ocean and attack the shores of both countries. The attack would happen so quickly that they would not even notice. Acklay,"I'm not fully aware of the armament of this monster, but from what I recall he would be vulnerable to anything above small arms fire. They would obviously cause an insane amount of damage, but I would think once the countries militaries were mobilized they'd be able to defeat them."
"argumenta sobre: All gangs merge into one, what's the strongest military they can beat? We are going to presume ALL crime syndicates cartel, gang, whatever name you give them will simultaneously merge into a single entity and are all teleported into the ground of a single country. The winner is whoever manages to make the other side give up in totality/disband to the point of being ineffectiveso getting the mega crime group to split up into their originals won't work, you need to make then ineffective in totality or reduce them to singular rouge members all doing their own thing. Edit:if you want to spice things up. You can consider an R2 where terrorist organisations/nations are added into the toll of crime syndicates.","I think this goes a lot better than you'd think, a lot of governments are under armed right now. Assuming the gangs keep their resources when teleported and don't just appear outside in the street, I'd say France is the weakest nation they couldn't take out. So pretty much any EU member state, any state in Africa, any state in South America, and possibly even Turkey would be kind of helpless to a multimillion man military force appearing in side their defenses. Only 6 or 7 countries are equipped to handle that right now. Although criminals tend to be more profit motivated than anything, so if we stop considering open warfare, a coalition of all organized crime on earth, could probably conquerer America by just bribing the right people to make the army stop existing and then getting brought in to replace the police as private contractors."
"argumenta sobre: How many space marines wh40k are needed to conquer earth from ""the Matrix""? How many space marine chapters are needed to conquer the real earth from the Matrix universe? Only space marines, no other human forces are allowed. Exterminatus and orbit bombing are not allowed.","People are sleeping on The Machines ITT. We dont' know an exact number of Sentinels, but it's a LOT. A chapter Astartes with 1,000 battle-brothers, each space marine is going to be outnumered at least 100:1, if not more. And the Space Marines won't have the benefit of a fortified undergound location with a single chokepoint. With superior maneuverability, far superior numbers, and a hyper intelligent hivemind, it's going to be pretty easy for the Sentinels to overwhelm exposed Space Marines on the surface. Now, heavy bolters will shred Sentinels, and I'm assuming it would only take a few shots from light bolters to drop a single Sentinel. And chain swords probably one-shot. Moreover, the power armor will be tough for the Sentinels to get through. But they can eventually pry/plasma torch the armor. And when a marine gets dogpiled by 100 Sentinels, what's he going to do? Now, Armor would change things. Most of the Space Marine's vehicles can go faster than Sentinels in open space. But once it comes to the tunnels or city ruins, the Sentinels could use their maneuvarability and coordination to latch on. And we saw what happened to the Nebuchadnezzar once the Sentiels latch on. TL;DR: It would take more than a single chapter to overcome the Machiness advantages. I estimate at least 5."
argumenta sobre: The Pope denounces pizza; claiming it's the food of the devil. Who loses more money? The church or the pizza industry? Pope Francis declares that pizza is evil and decrees that eating it damns you to hell. Does the pizza industry collapse or do people leave the catholic church in droves? What organization is dealt the most damage by this declaration?,"A lot of people are just straight ignoring that the pope has said plenty of things people have straight ignored. ""atheists go to heaven"" ""Who am I to judge"" in regards to gay people well before gay marriage was legalized. Saying if they live just lives, they go to heaven. Critiqued ""consumer culture, corporate greed and trickle down economics"" Said it was a ""moral obligation"" to combat climate change Yet you still get plenty of Catholics and Christians saying gays and atheists are going to hell and that climate change is fake. I actually question whether most Catholics and Christians would even hear about him denouncing pizza, except for it would become a meme and then they'd probably say ""NotMyPope"" or some other meme like response."

It'd take 24hrs to see significant military response but the Skaven can't really develop the necessary resources or plan in mere weeks to seize the city. Once the military and civilian militia from upstate arrive it's a matter of plinking the rats.
"argumenta sobre: 2 million civilians vs the US air force. 2 million civilians are trying to enter a top secret air force base in the middle of the desert. The civilians are of mixed gender, ethnicity and age, with different occupations. Some have guns, but most are only campers with tents, RV:s and fake weapons. The US air force is the US air force. They have had a couple of months of prep-time. They will do what's necessary, but will try to avoid lethal force if possible. The base has two miles of desert surrounding it, with only one car road going to the base. R1: the 2 million people are mostly just watching, while some are brave? enough to attack the base. R2: the 2 million people have formed a strategy, where they use the most of their knowledge and resources trying to infiltrate the base. R3: the 2 million people are all bloodlusted and will stop at nothing to take the base. any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental","Air Force stomps. There is no situation in which mostly unarmed, untrained civilians will breach an Air Force base that is seriously trying to defend itself."
"argumenta sobre: Ant-Man MCU, instead of changing size, instead has the ability to turn into a 500-foot tall ant. How does this change the MCU? Can he defeat Thanos in Infinity War? Assume there are no mental issues, square cube law, whatever; Ant-Man has full control over his body as a giant ant. Also assume he can lift 5,000 times his own weight, like most ants can. Bonus: What if he transformed into a 500-foot termite instead?","I'm going to use Bullet Ants because they were one of the ants Ant Man has used and I could find their size and weight. At their largest, they are 1.2 inches long and have a mass of 60 milligrams. A 500 foot ant would be one scaled by a factor of 5000. The weight should scale with the cube, so if I did my math right, would weight 7500 metric tons. Assuming that he can lift 5000 times his weight I'm pretty sure that it generally stated to be 50 times an ants weight, he can lift approximately 37.5 million metric tons. For comparison, an aircraft carrier displaces about 100,000 tons, the empire state building is 365,000 tons, and the great pyramid is roughly 6.5 million. While I couldn't find any stats on the Sanctuary 2, there is a very real chance that this Gi-Ant would be able to lift it and smash it into the ground. This means the Scarlet Witch probably tears Thanos apart and Spider-Man returns the gauntlet to the past. Captain Marvel cleans up."

"argumenta sobre: The Flash joins the Olympics, what game can he join where he can win always but no one will suspect him of having powers? Also he cannot intervene on the game itself or other players, for example: He joins the 200m and before the formation starts for running he proceeds to break everyone's toe to hinder them to running at their full capacity. THIS IS INVALID Also he cannot be suspected even after winning the game so using his powers in camera will be a problem.","He'd be an incredible boxer. His reaction time means nobody would be able to lay a glove on him, and he could break down his opponents with volume striking, peppering them with lightning fast jabs to set up power shots. He wouldn't be suspected of having powers, just as being absurdly athletic and nimble. There are plenty of smaller boxers in real life who look borderline superhuman when they move. He'd fit in perfectly. He also has superhuman healing factor, so there's no real risk of injury. The only chance of suspicion being raised would be if he sustained a cut or a broken nose in a fight, which then instantly healed. So he'd have to make sure he didn't get hit hard in the face."
"argumenta sobre: Who could win, Rambo vs. Predator, the one from the first movie? They both fought in the jungle, only the Predator attacked an entire team, and Rambo is an expert at fighting at a disadvantage. , knows how to hide and ambush, who could win","I agree that Rambo is on the same level of skill, if not slightly better, as Dutch's team. The issue is, if neither side knows about each other's capabilities, the Predator should be able to fuck him up before Rambo ever gets the chance to learn about how the Predator's stealth cloaking works, it's weapons, it's thermal vision, etc. Dutch had the advantage of having his team die one by one, and with each death more info about the Predator was revealed. There's no way for Rambo to tell where the Predator is, even if he's made aware that something is after him in the jungle. And the Predator would just see him, and hunt him from a distance. If Rambo has any weaponry, the Predator is shooting him with plasma, ripping out his spine, and calling it a day. With prepared foreknowledge on both sides, I can see Rambo getting the win."

argumenta sobre: How deadly would xenomorphs be in real life? Imagine if xenomorphs were real and we had to deal with them. How long would civilisation last? How dangerous would they be? What would be the response of governments? Police force? The army?,"This is absolutely lethal. A biological species that is invulnerable to disease. A biological species that is inedible for any other animal, fungus, plant, or bacteria - but can itself eat all of the above. A biological species that reaches maturity and combat capability from a single cell in less than a day. A biological species that, when there is a shortage of prey, does not die of hunger like normal animals, but hibernates and can wait for centuries for new food to appear. Compared to this, rabbits in Australia and rats in the New York subway will seem like endangered species from the Red Book. This is absolutely the end of any ecosystem. Yes, a pack of xenomorphs is not dangerous for a well-armed and disciplined military unit in a direct confrontation. But even the coolest military unit has to eat something.

"argumenta sobre: You must fight Batman. You get to choose any one power for yourself for the fight. However, Batman gets to ask 20 yes/no questions to try and determine what power you have. If he guesses it, you lose the power and you have to fight him barehanded. What power can let you win? Rules: - Batman/Bruce will simply be in his underwear with no weapons or armor. You can wear your regular street clothes if you like. - To avoid him instantly speedblitzing you, you start at opposite ends of a football field. - He can ask any question he wants, and will be doing his best to whittle down entire categories by asking things like ""will it let you hit me from a distance?"" or ""will it affect my ability to perceive you?"" or ""if a 10-year old had this power, is there a reasonable chance that YOU could beat him?"". - He gets 3 minutes to prepare a strategy before asking the first question, then 30 seconds after your answers to ask each additional question. - His guess needs to be pretty close, but it doesn't have to be exact. He needs to have the basic ideas behind your powers down, but doesn't need to have the exact incidental details. If you choose ""Spawning 143 northeastern bald faced hornets per second out of my left hand"" as your power, and he guesses that you can summon or generate stinging insects, that's a win for him. - If he doesn't get your power within 20 guesses, his memory of the conversation will be erased to keep him from deducing which powers you do or don't have, and all he'll know is that he needs to incapacitate you. - Should go without saying, but you have to answer honestly. Edit - I specified in the title that the power is for the fight. I'll clarify that that means you don't get the power while you're being questioned by him.

So Joker and Batman would both go down, but Penguin and the Falcones would prosper. Catwoman would go down in hours.

It has half a dozen pilots working shifts. It's task is to eliminate the Luftwaffe, destroying it and its airbases within Germany, France and other occupied european territory. Now it would obviously shred anything 1v1 in the sky. But would it easily destroy an entire squadron without taking a hit? How would German Flak do against it? Does it have the systems to easily avoid the steel cables suspended from balloons used as stationary defense?",You didn't put any restrictions on the unlimited ammo and the F-35A is certified to carry a nuclear payload.

"argumenta sobre: The arguably most incompetent general in modern human history Lt. Gen. Mutaguchi Renya leads an army of the most incompetent soldier in recorded history ISIS fighter Abu Hajaar. Assuming following conditions, what army, fictional or nonfictional, LOSES to them? Background Inside For purposes of brevity, we will refer to the army of Abu Hajaars + Gen. Renya as the Dream Team. Background: Our incompetent commander: Lieutenant General Mutaguchi Renya of the Imperial Japanese Army. Despite his high position within the Imperial Japanese Army, General Renya had no idea how to mount a campaign, no less organize logistics or create a coherent strategy. This can be best seen in the debacle that was the Battle of Imphal, in which the Japanese attempted to invade India, but was beaten back into the Jungles of Burma and slowly starved over the course of 4 months. Due to poor planning by Gen. Renya, 55k troops out of 90k died during the campaign, mostly from sickness and starvation. Historians argue that the disastrous loss of life and eventual retreat without gaining anything of substance hastened Japan's defeat at the hands of the allies. Due to his actions, Lt. Gen Renya was reviled as one of the 'Three Filths' 三大汚物 of the Japanese Army. From Wikipedia: > The Japanese defeat at Kohima and Imphal was the largest up until that time,2 with many of the Japanese deaths resulting from starvation, disease and exhaustion suffered during their retreat. Just to give you guys an idea of how incompetent he was, here are some quotes by our commander: In which he explains his so-called Genghis-Khan tactic of transporting supply through the Jungle: > Instead of motorized vehicles, we can transport supplies on cows or horses, and when those supplies are spent, we can eat the animals. Anyone who was raised in a farm knows this is a bad idea since domesticated beasts of burden require hay or other prepared foods to meet their immense caloric requirements. Should this be unavailable, the herbivores need to graze for hours on end since just raw plant matter isn't dense in calories. Furthermore, Jungles are host to thousands of species of plants, many of which are poisonous. When this plan inevitably failed, it fell to the soldiers to carry the supplies - contributing to exhaustion and loss of morale. In which he reprimands a commander for retreating when his men literally ran out of food: > 諸君、佐藤烈兵団長は、軍命に背きコヒマ方面の戦線を放棄した。食う物がないから戦争は出来んと言って勝手に退りよった。これが皇軍か。皇軍は食う物がなくても戦いをしなければならないのだ。兵器がない、やれ弾丸がない、食う物がないなどは戦いを放棄する理由にならぬ。弾丸がなかったら銃剣があるじゃないか。銃剣がなくなれば、腕でいくんじゃ。腕もなくなったら足で蹴れ。足もやられたら口で噛みついて行け。日本男子には大和魂があるということを忘れちゃいかん。日本は神州である。神々が守って下さる... > Commander Sato abandoned the Kohima front of the battle against issued orders. He did so with the excuse that his men ran out of food. You call this the Imperial Army? The Imperial Army must fight when they have no food. not having weapons, ammunition, or food are not an excuse to give up fighting. You have bayonets if you have no bullets. Use your fists if you have no bayonets. If your fists are unusable, kick them with your feet. If your feet are unusable, bite them with your teeth. Japanese men have the Yamato Spirit, do not forget. Japan is the nation of Gods, Gods will protect us..."" In which he answers the complaints of the advance platoons that they have nothing to eat: > 日本人はもともと草食動物なのである。これだけ青い山を周囲に抱えながら、食料に困るなどというのは、ありえないことだ > Japanese people are originally herbivores. When we are surrounded by the verdant jungle, it is impossible for us to low run on food. Honestly this guy is a gold mine for stupid quotes, but this post is already getting too long. Our Incompetent Soldier: ISIS Fighter Abu Hajaar This Video shows you everything that you need to know, but it can be summed up in this one quote: ""What is wrong with you, Abu Hajaar?"" Video Summary of his incompetent feats: Pelts his friend who was preparing an anti-vehicle rocket launcher with hot bullet casings from his machine gun Doesn't set up his MG3 Machine Gun properly, causing himself to be knocked backwards by the recoil and peppers the interior of the vehicle with bullets, nearly killing his allies Stands on ammunition so that his mates can't get to them Roasts his friends from backdraft from an RPG Can't tell the difference between anti-personal vs anti-vehicle rockets Doesn't take off safety cap off of his rockets prior to firing THROWS HOMEMADE GRENADE TO THE FLOOR IN FRUSTRATION WHEN IT DOESN'T FIT rolls around in the open with no cover, thinking it will protect him when he is forced to exit the vehicle. The Rules of the Battle: Remember, the goal is to pick a commander and an army fictional or nonfictional that is so dysfunctional, it will lose against the dream team. The army that goes against our dream team should be composed of at least 1 commander. The Dream Team will adjust its number of men i.e. Abu Hajaars to match that of the opposing army. The Dream Team is armed with armaments and vehicles that can be seen in the video. They also gain access to equipement and vehicles that the Japanese Imperial Army would have had in the year 1944. For balance, the challengers should at least be on similar level of weapons technology as the Dream Team, or should have hax that will let them fight vs the Dream Team on even footing. However, if the challengers are so incompetent that they will lose vs the dream team even with more advanced technology, that is allowed. You may mix and match the challenging commanders and army. You can take a commander out of the appropriate time period to command the opposing army example: if you want to use a really incompetent 13th century army general from France, you may use him to command an army with appropriate tech level. In such a case, assume that the commander is familiar with modern technology. The commanders of both sides are responsible for organizing logistics/communication/strategy and making sure the men in their command carries out their orders. The battle conditions are as follows: Both sides must capture and hold a jungle island that is separated by 1000 km of ocean from their home nation/main base. The island is a perfect circle with a diameter of 100km with gentle sloping beachheads, But rises up to a single mountain, 1000m above sea level in the center. The mountain slopes are gentle. The jungle starts 500m away from the shore, and quickly thickens. There are some sources of fresh water on the island. An array of 20 freshwater springs are present on the island. Each spring can supply up to 500 men per day, and they are located 50km away from the center of the island in a way that they form an evenly spaced circle. Suppose that both sides have landed at the exact same time on opposite sides of the island. Bonus: What is the most technologically primitive army that can beat the dream team?","The Spanish Army as it was on the eve of the Battle of Talevera, 1809. A squadron of dragoons french light cavalry was wandering around near the spanish position, out of musket range, when the entire line fired without orders. The resulting noise caused four whole battalions, those same battalions who had JUST FIRED, to drop weapons and run. They routed themselves into panic with their own volley! Lt Gen Renya and his army of Abu Hajaars could probably stay in bed..."

"argumenta sobre: Could the Mongol Empire conquer the New World? One week after the Mongols conquered the Khwarazmian Empire in 1221, Genghis Khan and everyone in his army is suddenly teleported across the ocean and end up in what is now modern day Alaska. Confused by this sudden change in scenery, the Mongols immediately become bloodlusted and start a new campaign, intending to conquer aa much of North America as possible! Could the Mongols conquer 1221 North America? If they can't realistically conquer ALL of North America, how far can the Mongols realistically get before being permanently stymied by the North American terrain? Breakdown of the combatants: All the Mongols are given their standard issue weapons including siege weapons, armor and horses. Objective: Conquer as much of 1221 North America as plausibility allows.","They would all die in Alaska. There's a reason the Mongols never conquered Siberia. Okay, let's assume they spawn in the American Prairies instead. The main problem I see is that the Mongols would have a very hard time replenishing their horses. There were no horses in the Americas before the Europeans brought them back over. Meaning any Mongol that loses his steed would just be a walking target until more horses are bred. I see them conquering all of the Great Plains without too many problems. The more organized states of Mexico would be very tough, but the Mongols would probably win through the influence of Old World disease ravaging the population. Their cavalry-based armies absolutely cannot cross the Central American jungle, the deserts of the west coast, or the woodlands of the east coast. At max, I think you'd have an empire stretching from the center of Mexico to Alberta, with the Rocky Mountains as the western border and the Mississippi or Appalachians as the eastern border."

"argumenta sobre: Could Denjichainsaw man hold down a job as a member of the sevenThe Boys for a year? Denji replaces Starlight in the first episode of The Boys TV show. He really needs the money and being a supe pays well, so he is motivated to hold on to the job. This means he isnt fired and doesnt get into any serious fights with the other supes. Can he do it? R1: Denji right when he gains his powers in part 1. R2: Denji after eating Makima in part 2, he needs the money to care for Nayuta. R3: Denji at the current point in the CSM manga.","Every member of The Seven is going to look down on Denji. Denji is a teenager who knows very little in the world and wears his naivety on his face. Not only that, but the practicality of his powers are very difficult to see in the situations The Seven are typically deployed, which are military deployments where they stomp down a bunch of normal soldiers, which he can do, but just in a offputting and animalistic way. In other words, no member of The Seven is going to have a positive impression of him other than maybe Black Noir. Denji is willing to tolerate a lot from a woman, but he has little to no tolerance to a man. He did kick Aki in the nuts for trying that ""tough teaching"" method on him and that's part 1 Denji who was desperate for an upgrade in life from eating fucking cigarettes everyday. All of this is to say that he will be harassed and Denji won't be able to just take it. Homelander will consider him unmarketable and will try to bully him off the team or try and ""clean up his act"", Denji would be a smart ass because Homelander isn't a hot woman, Homelander would get physical and... yeah, that's the end of that for pretty much any round. I don't think Denji even lasts long enough on the team to know the shady shit Vought is up to. And lets be real, it doesn't even need to be Homelander specifically, it could be the Deep too that ends things. That being said, Denji is pretty fucking strong, so he might just successfully kill Homelander, then Vought cleans it up and keeps Denji on the team despite the incident, in which case he stays on the team with little issue until Firecracker eventually joins and grooms him in which case, she succeeds at doing so in round 1 and 2, but probably fails in round 3. You'd think Stormfront could do it, but Denji is Japanese, I think Firecracker loves the bag enough to not care despite the right winger grift she has going on, but Stormfront is a literal Nazi so that's just not happening."

"argumenta sobre: Can every insect on Earth kill all humans within an hour? All the insects are driven solely by instinct and no unifying force or hivemind. They don't consider strategy, they just fly towards humans and mindless try to kill them. If even one human survives the world resets to before the apocalypse, with nobody having any memory of it.

Bonus Round: assuming the Hive Tyrant can kill everything in Rome, is there a year in history, pre-modernity, where Rome could collectively kill it?","People are massively overestimating the Tyranids in this thread IMO. R1: Pretty easy but with moderate body count. Termigaunts don't regenerate especially fast and it will eventually run out of ammo if it's not brought down with sheer numbers. Termigaunts are also not smart so it'll just a brief rampage. R2 & 3: Brought down but with significant body count. There's plenty of cases in the lore where the guard or a named character kill these with just a melee weapon. Eventually someone will get a lucky stab in or it will get drowned by a roman legions numbers. Biggest threat is the genestealer hiding in the sewer and terrorizing the city for weeks / months. R4 & 5: Now things get interesting here. Both the carnifex and tyrant can survive even hits from a tank and regenerate from them quickly. There's nothing in rome that can kill either in a straight fight. Small chance the romans could lure the carnifex into a trap and kill it that way, say by dropping a large building on it or something. I give the Carnifex 8/10 and the Tyrant 10/10. The other rounds 0/10, no way they're taking rome on their own."
"argumenta sobre: One lightly armed 7 year old every day for ten years, or an ordinary military aged male. Who would win? The male knows all the rules. The 7 year olds can only attack once every 24 hour period. Each 24 hour period is 6am to 6am. Only one 7 year old can attack at a time. Only melee weapons a 7 year old could reasonably handle may be used by the 7 year olds. No ranged weapons or projectiles of any kind. Knives, daggers, small clubs, spears etc. The 7 year olds have not been trained for this but are given enough info to use their weapons decently for a 7 year old. The male has access to clean water, food, and shelter, but must venture outside to tend to crops and livestock at least twice a day if not more. The male also has access to a small workshop with limited supplies. He can fashion reasonable traps and weapons but supplies are hard to come by. He might be able to go scrap searching once a month to refurbish supplies in small quantites for such things. He has enough electricity to power an alarm clock and charge batteries for a dim crappy flashlight, otherwise his light comes from a kerosene lamp and stove at night. He lives isolated in a forest near the edge of an abandoned town. Edit: Update So far the consenus boils mostly down to two schools of thought. 1. 10 years is a LOT of time.

A. he never gets cut or burned on mustifar, and wins against obi wan. And then reaches his full potential. B. Vader gets his suit and gets used to it, and then reaches his full potential. Who would be stronger? Who would most likely win?","Full potential Anakin is inherently more powerful than Vader because Vader by definition is a corruption of Anakin by his demons. So he's always going to be weighed down by them. There's a period where he may be more powerful, but by definition of Anakin reaching his full potential he will have overcome his fears, uncertainty, and insecurity you see pop up and self sabotage over the prequels and Clone Wars. That would lead him to ultimately be a much smarter fighter and able to exploit those very weaknesses in a less centered Vader. By the way, I don't think full potential Anakin is necessarily a pure light side Anakin based on his interactions with the Father, Son, and Daughter.

"argumenta sobre: Weakest character who can beat a D&D PC which has reached max level in every class? This is a fair duel. The PC is not ambushed in their bed, nor do they have their meal poisoned secretly. The PC only has official 5E classes. As far as the Wish spell, let's be realistic and assume that the Dungeon Master is not willing to grant a wish that neutralizes this encounter they prepared, but is fine with the suggested uses within the description of the spell. Let's also assume that the player is reluctant to risk a 33% chance of losing the Wish spell forever.","Nerevarine from Morrowind who abuses the alchemy system. In Morrowind potion effects stack. Keep in mind at 100% magic and elemental resist in Morrowind you become immune to those types of damage. Morrowind also has spell absorption which at 100% just absorbs the spell while taking no damage. Reflect just reflects the cast spell back at the caster at 100% reflect. All of those effects can be made with alchemy. So that takes care of the magic aspect. But wait there is more. Alchemy can be used to boost the attributes themselves. Say strength or intelligence. Like I said potions stack. Potion strength and length scale off of intelligence. So if a player so wanted they could chug a bunch of intelligence potions and then make more intelligence potions and cause a feedback loop of making stronger and stronger potions that last longer and longer. It is possible to make potions that boost attributes into the 100s of thousands that last real life years. Not in game years real life years. As in you could leave the game running for years and the potion effects would not go away. After they have what they consider intelligence enough they can start to work on potions for the other stats. Like speed, strength, agility, and luck. In game no one boosts speed that much because the character becomes to fast to control in game. Strength can be boosted to high that you can one shot just about anything in existence. Agility effects hit chance and dodge chance. Enough said. Luck effects everything you do in a small way. Not very useful at low numbers. But a few million luck well now that makes luck effect everything you do in a big way because you are officially the luckiest son of a bitch in existence. The type of guy who is banned from playing the lottery because you won it 10 times in a row and they thought you were cheating somehow. As far as the melee Morrowind also has a spell effect called sanctuary. What sanctuary does is make you harder to hit in melee. Throw that in with a super high enough agility and luck stat and you are not getting hit by anyone unless they really got lucky. So if the Nerevarine does all this we have a guy who is immune to all types of magic. Who can run fast enough to break the sound barrier or even a good fraction of the speed of light depending on how much they boosted speed. Who has enough strength to kill a god with one punch. Is so agile that he can dodge just about anything. Is the luckiest son of a bitch in existence. And is so hard to hit that your odds of doing so might as well be 0. Yeah there is a reason no one who plays Morrowind plays like this unless they are just messing around. But you can and that is why we love it."

"argumenta sobre: Mihawk is now the ""worlds greatest swordsman"" in all of fiction. Who's the strongest character he can beat? To elaborate on what I mean, Mihawk now directly scales above characters who prominently use a sword in their kit. This has nothing to do with whether they can theoretically use a sword or have used one occasionally, it has to be a relevant aspect of their character. For example, Superman has yeh sword of Superman technically, however he would not count, however Wonder Woman regularly has her sword so she does count. It may seem arbitrary but honestly using common sense should suffice.","Stronger than some bullshit OP SCPs out there. Means that he is already stronger than nearly everything as most of fiction is below planet busting level due to realism being predominant. Stronger than Ultimate Dirk Strider from Homestuck adds on more bullshit OP swordsmen he is stronger than.

"argumenta sobre: Everyone in the world fights everyone else. Who comes out on top? The fights happen independently of one another, assuming every fight is fresh. Who is the most likely to come out on top as in beat everyone else. Or at least win against most people. Assumptions: 1. No weapons 2. Perfect refresh after every battle 3. Knock out, death or surrender count as victories 4. There is a flat arena 5. People fight in their prime Thinking about it, UFC is one big part of it but at the same time heavier weight competitors, such as strong men jump to mind","Not offering a winner, but ill thin out the herd based on your conditions. To fill in some points you have missed, ill assume combatants are in a no holds barred match, and they are forced to fight physically, and in a set time frame ie no running away forever, or other weird tactics. I am also assuming here that fighters are able to watch footage of their competions prior fights and learn from these. To address your specific conditions: 1st condition : Everyone in the world. Let's rule out anyone without extensive 1 : 1 fight training. We can also rule out anyone that's weak, infirm, etc. You did say ""In their prime"" but some peoples prime just isn't that prime. Not to be too sexist / agest , but with 1 : 1 fighting of everyone in the world in their prime, we could probably rule out almost all females and anyone under 17 or so immediately. Result : Very fit and strong males, with extensive fight training only 2nd condition :Perfect refresh after every fight Assuming refresh time is given, you have essentially ruled out anyone in the lower weight classes as that is the major advantage for not carrying heaps of weight. I am also assuming you mean all injuries are healed before the next round. result: light heavyweights and above only 3rd condition : knockout, death or surrender count as victories. 8 billion people participating in a knock-out tournament would take a surprisingly short 33 rounds. 33 rounds however is way too many to rely on luck, or a gimmick so, we could rule out any one trick ponies, or single discipline fighters. 33 fights to the possible death would also take a fair toll on a person mentally even with full physical recovery, so we could rule out anyone that was mentally not prepared for full contact fighting. Result : multi displine fighters with an extensive toolbox of moves and a very businesslike attitude to fighting 4th and 5th condition. Flat arena, and people fight in their prime. result : no change from whats covered above, So. in summary, our champion would likely be a male, over 100kg / 220lb but likely a lot more. extensively trained in striking, standing and ground work, and almost psychotically prepared to do what it takes to win. eye gouging, nut shots etc. Candidates would be a fighter in the physical style of Emelianenko, Couture or Ngannou, but prepared to be utter assholes in the fight to get the win."

"argumenta sobre: How much of a speed and strength increase would it take to make melee combat viable in modern day warfare? Not overpowering, just a viable option. Make it like a 50/50 when it comes to ranged and melee combat. I was inspired for this one based off of Wonder-Woman 2017. What kind of boost would be required for melee divisions to be added to warfare?","> People need to be faster than bullets Lol, no they don't. If we are talking line infantry, in WW2 25,000 rounds were shot for every kill. Want to look at a modern war? It was 200,000 rounds per kill in 'Nam. Let's use the WW2 figure. That's 99.996% of shots missing human sized targets moving normal human speed. Trying to hit something the size of a human moving the speed of a car is going to be exponentially more difficult. Especially if we are basing this off superheroes and assuming no loss of mobility and agility. Acceleration is probably more important than top speed, but being able to move at 100+mph is probably fine, even if you are still subsonic. Your 100 mile-an-hour Supe isn't going to be beating an artillery strike or a carpet bombing. But neither is your normal human with an M16."
"argumenta sobre: An average guy is wearing every corrupting magic item there is, including the One Ring, The Ice King's Crown and a Red Lantern Ring. Which one wins control over him? If there is a corrupting magic item that activates in some way other than wearing it, assume that he has activated it in that way. Some more ideas: the necronomicon, the monkey's paw, various haunted houses. Edit: So far, the one I find most convincing is the Mask's mask. It could probably turn everything else mentioned so far into a plastic toy. Edit 2: Of the suggestions here which I'm familiar with, I think the answer must be the white lantern ring, Sukuna's fingers or, again, the Mask's mask. Here are my reasons. White Lantern Ring: White Lanterns are able to use all of the colors without their corruptive side effects. Not only can the white lantern ring bring its wielder back to life from the other items which would kill him, but the fact that using it destroys any black lantern ring which the wielder has means it would likely destroy the Lich King's helm of domination and frostmourne, and maybe even the One Ring and SCP-350. As for the rest, lanterns generally have powerful resistance to mind control. Even if they are able to instill impulses in him, the limited free will of white lanterns means that he probably wont be able to act on them. All in all, a much better ending than I would have suspected. The only things that make me question this one is I'm not sure if we can call the white lantern ring ""corrupting"" and I don't know if it can defend against Sukuna physically transforming the guy's body into his own. Sukuna's Fingers: I think they might win by technicality, just because if the guy is transformed mind and body into Sukuna,, then Sukuna has completely acquired the guy even if Sukuna then is targeted by all of the curses himself. The Mask's mask's complete bodily control might be able to prevent Sukuna from taking over.","Not just the one ring, but also the 7 dwarven rings and the 9 human rings. That's a lot of rings"

Scenario two: a North-American forest from 70 million years ago. Bonus round: a T-Rex the size of a adult male lion x an actual lion.","Lion, all rounds. The T-Rex is used to hunting smaller prey. While it will occasionally battle creatures its own size, its going to be typically going after creatures that are smaller than it because that's how you take less damage hunting as a solitary hunter. How does it get up when it gets knocked over? Awkwardly, for example. The Lion is used to engaging things at or larger than its size. That's what its built for. If a creature knocks it over it gets right back up. Scaled up, its claws will hurt the T-Rex even through its feathers. Also its bite will be sufficient to damage the T-Rex."
"argumenta sobre: Every vehicle in the world will become evil and bloodthirsty against animals and people. Can mankind and the animal kingdom survive? Truck, car, sedan, bicycle, emergency vehicle, helicopter, and boat will attack humans and animals. If they cannot directly reach us, they will release chemicals or cause their own destruction through any means necessary solely to spite us. Carriages, wagons, and anything pulled by a horse is unaffected. Round 1: It's us versus every major car manufacturer in the world. Round 2: Boats, helicopters, and planes are unaffected. Round 3: Cars not considered ""modern"" are unaffected. How many rounds do humans/animals survive?","I can't see ""vehicles"" doing enough to kill all of the animal kingdom so I'll focus on humans. In all rounds bar 3, I take four cars directly into my front door, though they're likely not designed for the offroading required to push through it. There isn't enough space to build up speed. They try to smoke me out and fail through either engine failure or ventilation. In Round 3, 3/4 cars in the driveway are quite old, and one of them is parked conveniently in the way of the car new enough to try. In all 3, assuming I don't get a plane landing on me I'm fine short term. 1: Humans are long-term put back to the mid 19th century I am assuming the same rules for horse and cart apply to buggies with transportation. Humanity survives, though climate change is put into overdrive and billions die. OP, are steam driven wagons allowed? If trains are then I assume they are, and they'd likely take over from cars, though in much more ""car-like"" bodies. 2: Probably far better: there's simply far less capacity for environmental damage, which will be the biggest long term problem. Logistics is properly fucked until train lines are expanses enough to take over from trucks and international travel goes back to cruise liners, but it's not terminal. 3: Define modern. The median age of a car in the US is 2013 right now for example: is that fair? Or do you mean like a classic Mini, or a Model T, or... Either way we win, but it's a hell of a lot easier to rebuild the more modern you go."

Rules • Link has decided to try snatching Shantae to put her into an Empty Bottle, so he can mock Ganon for now having a genie albeit half-genie at his disposal. • He has to get his hands on her and press her against the bottle. She will become small enough to be forced inside. • Shantae will not try to fight back, only willing to run from him. Only if she has nowhere to run will she fight. • If an hour goes by, Link will give up on capturing Shantae. • In all rounds, Link starts 100 meters from Shantae. • Each version of Link gets all their feats and abilities from their universes. They will start off easy with moderate-level equipment, armor, and dozens of arrows and other projectiles, but will switch to their best loadout if desperate.

A'right then. I'm just going off Shantae's RT cuz I don't know the character, but assuming I'm not missing anything drastic in there, the answers to the first three should be... R1\ This is also Majora's Mask Link, so he equips the Stone Mask to become invisible and walks right up to her. R2\ This is also Phantom Hourglass Link, so he stops time and walks right up to her. R3\ This is probably the strongest Link without needing any strength-boosting items as OoT Link does, so he can easily pull her in with his Clawshot given his strength feats crush hers. The question is if she could just dodge it. I'm not seeing any feats from her which would let her do so, but you probably know the character better than me. If she can, then it becomes an extended chase, but I still favor Link in that; his Wolf mode seems faster than her, and he can literally teleport him to multiple sites in and around Faron Woods. Unless the bird she summons with her whistle can just fly her straight into the sky out of his reach, in which case that's that I guess. I honestly hate Skyward Sword so much that I don't really remember all his capabilities, so no comment on that one. And I haven't gotten around to playing TotK yet. cute battle though \^\\^"

argumenta sobre: Tu-95 vs A-10 guns only dogfight Who would win in a dogfight between modern versions of the A-10 and Tu-95 if they can only use guns? Obviously it's an attacker vs a bomber which doesn't make much sense but they do both have guns meant to be capable of killing other aircraft and at least in the same ballpark of burst mass. 20 kg/s The Tu-95 is also quite a bit faster in a straight line meaning that it can probably prevent the A-10 from chasing it and the tail turret is radar-controlled i.e. it's an aimbot and has something like 60 degrees of traverse in all directions except only 40 degrees of depression. It only has about 500 23mm rounds as opposed to 1125 30mm rounds for the A-10 so clearly there is a lot less ammo for the Tu-95.,This is like asking which boat wins in a drag race. On land.

The Military will use the best jets, most powerful guns and so on but No nukes but Missiles are allowed. The Star destroyer is high up in the sky, not in space, specifically in the Stratosphere above New York with the Tie Fighters ready to Deploy and Attack","Sort of. The U.S. probably wouldn't be able to get close to it, but the TIE fighters are no match for the ludicrous amount of anti air the U.S. has at its disposal. Plus the air force make up these scenarios as training exercises, of which they have a contingency plan for alien invasion. No nukes is tricky, because these contingency plans rely on them. A direct attack would be suicide thanks to the stupid amount of turbo lasers and unmanuaverable aircraft. Artillery would most likely have the best chance because star destroyers rely on energy shielding and can't really stop an artillery barrage except by shooting it down. But, since it is one star destroyer, there is plenty enough artillery to go around. Edit: with nukes off the table can we null the orbital bombardment? In legends nukes are the easiest way to take down a star destroyer, so I feel like glassing a continent should also be disallowed"

He can now manipulate the size of anything he touches at an atomic level changing it proportionally from up to 100 times bigger or to 10k times smaller by either length or weight as he desires. The objects remain their property and for organisms they retain their biological functions and do not suffer from any otherwise scientific drawbacks like they are supposed to. He also has a passive aura that automatically shrinks down any hostile things within 10 meters around him to 10k times smaller, including projectiles, hostile animals, any gas,liquid meant to harm him etc. He can also touch himself to either increase/decrease his own size and has stats scaled accordingly. The world does not know of this evil man's power, yet, until anyone figures out. He can either lay low or go on rampage to cause as much chaos as possible and to destroy the economy and major world powers could he do it?",Assuming he has range limitation like 10 meters he could: He could use a pistol and change bullet weight to low when it accelerates and change it to heavy when it exists. 9mm bullet used like this would have very roughly 459 million joules of energy without any recoil. That would easily destroy dozen tanks in one shot if they were lined up. Shotgun would be hilarious. He could basically create vacuum tunnel for the bullet too so that air doesn't slow it. He could make aura that diminishes incoming fire by making it weigh nearly nothing He could make vacuum shield to avoid shockwave damage at the same time too. Missiles would kill him easily with their heat release. Powerful laser would melt him too.

Only reset guy remembers what happened in the timeframe before his death. Once the 1000 resets are spent, reset guy could now be killed permanently. Other than his reset ability, reset guy still has the stats of a regular human male and has no weapons other than his fists. The guy with the gun is armed with an m1911 with only 1 magazine containing 9 rounds. Gun guy has some experience in shooting a gun and how to use it. Gun guy takes 3 seconds to aim at reset guy so reset guy gets a 3 second head start in every reset. Both combatants start 15 feet away from one another. Battle takes place in an empty storage warehouse. Who wins?",Totally doable. 3 seconds to cross 15ft is plenty of time its just a matter of what he does when he gets to gun guy. Reset guy likely still dies a bunch before he figures out a good way to wrestle the gun away and kill gun guy.
"argumenta sobre: 150 Death Angels from ''A Quiet Place'' arrives right after the invasion of Poland ends in 1939 The Death Angels arrives in 1939 after the germans invades Poland. A meteorite crashes in Hamburg, and the death angels are released. 150 of them only. This interupt Hitler's plan to start his conquest of Europe because the angel aliens will attack anything nearby that makes sound. So can the german military resist against 150 of these fast and agile aliens?","They could potnetially destroy anything in that era because modern weapons don't work on them. as long as they don't get drowned or having their weakness exposed they are kinda invincible. In the source material its pretty weird that other people didn't figure out their weaknesses before the protags but in a realisitic scenario, i think people might be able to figure it out then its pretty easy to exploit it and kill them."
"argumenta sobre: Who would win in a fight: one Space Marine in a murderous rage without his armor and weapons VS 100 bloodthirsty male silverback gorillas on meth and steroids? Assume the fight takes place in an open, neutral battlefield - no weapons for the Space Marine. The gorillas are hyper-aggressive, enhanced beyond natural limits by a cocktail of meth and steroids, essentially turning them into unrelenting, muscle-bound killing machines with no fear or self-preservation instinct. The Space Marine is in full combat armor, trained for centuries in warfare, and currently in a berserker-like rage. He's not holding back. This is a fight to the death. No retreat, no reinforcements. Just pure, brutal chaos. Who walks away?",Bullets annoy him like splinters. Apes can't hurt him.
"argumenta sobre: Super Mario vs Nazi Germany The year is 1942. Adolf Hitler has kidnapped Princess Peach and has her locked up in his bunker in Berlin. Mario is facing his biggest challenge yet, so he has mustered the ability to use a multitude of his powers and skills from the different games to beat this. These are his attributes: He is 120cm tall and is wearing his standard red and blue outfit. He can run and jump without getting tired. He can jump 3m vertically triple jump and 8m horizontally long jump. He can spin jump on all animals, enemies and plants without getting hurt. He can jump on walls. He takes no fall damage. He can breath in space and underwater forever. He can twirl in the air to fly longer. His gravity is halved during nighttime. He can throw his cap to damage and kill enemies, and to slam open doors. He can jump on bullets and missiles, grab them and throw them back. He can eat any red mushroom to grow twice in size and to receive one extra hit point. He can eat any red flower to receive the ability to throw infinite fireballs from his hands. He can eat any acorn to receive the ability to fly with a wingsuit. He can eat any feather to receive a cape and the ability to fly. He can eat any blue mushroom to become very tiny 10cm. He can shoot any crystal he finds as a fast projectile that stuns enemies. He has 5 lives as a start. If he is hit by anything explosion, enemy, bullet, punch or similar, he loses one hit point or a life. He is invulnerable for three seconds after being hit by something, unless he has no power-up. If he collects 100 gold coins he receives one extra life. He can have at most 99 lives. He can teleport through paintings to wherever the painting represents. Mario can only use one power-up at the time, just as in the games. Germany is the real life equivalent back in 1942 and they all know that Mario is coming and will shoot him on sight. They cannot harm Peach, only lock her up. No other country will help Mario either, so he is all alone in his quest. Hitler dies if Mario jumps on his head three times, or by 35 fireballs. All other enemies die from one hit. Vehicles are invulnerable. Mario starts in Paris. His mission is to kill Hitler, rescue Princess Peach and escape Germany unharmed before the war ends in 1945. Can he do it?","If Mario gets very lucky then I say he can do it, since I doubt he's fast enough to dodge bullets consistently"

Saw this ""meme"" and thought it was interesting. Some ground rules: You choose two of the following ""groups"" to protect you. They will follow basic commands and will protect you with thier lives if necessary. The rest are bloodlusted and will stop at nothing to kill you. Your choices are: 1. An average human male with 7 years experience hunting deer. Armed with a Ruger American Rifle No sight. He has 50 rounds of .308. 2. Three male grizzly bears weighing in at 600lbs each. 3. Four Male Lions weighing in at 400lbs each. 4. Five male silverback gorillas weighing in at 400lbs each. 5. Seven adult bulls weighing in at 1800lbs each. 6. Ten male saltwater crocodiles weighting in at 1600lbs each. 7. 15 adult grey wolves weighing 110lbs each. 8. 50 adult female golden eagles with 7ft wingspans weighing 14lbs each. 9. 10,000 large brown rats weighing about 1lb each. You're on an island that is 1 square mile, it is surrounded by saltwater, and has four equally sized quadrants. 1 is a wetland, but the water is no deeper than 2 feet anywhere. 1 is a Forrest. 1 is Rocky and mountainous. 1 is a grassy plain. You're dropped in the very middle and the groups you choose are with you. The groups attacking you start in the area most like thier natural habitat. They don't know exactly where you are but know you are on the island and will hunt you. What do you choose and what is your strategy for survival?","The first choice is, without question, the 10k rats. That's a lot of rats - they kill everything they can hurt. They also are good at inducing panic. The ones I'd say can stand up to the rats most effectively are the crocs and the eagles, so we take one of them. I think smart use of foliage can let your rats deal with the eagles, so we take the crocs and go to a marsh or swamp area."

"argumenta sobre: At what distance would Eliud Kipchoge Marathon World Record holder vs. Usain Bolt 100m World Record holder be a 50-50 race? Assume both athletes are in their prime. Eliud Kipchoge - Has the world record for a marathon at 2:01:39 average speed of close to 13mph. Widely regarded as the greatest marathon runner of all-time having won 11 of the 12 marathons he has entered. - Enjoyed success at the middle distance range with a 1500m PB of 3:33 and mile PB of 3:50. - He's no slouch at sprinting either and is capable of sub-55 laps when he kicks at the end of a race. Usain Bolt - Considered to be the greatest sprinter of all-time with world records in the 100m 9.58 and 200m 19.19 clocking speeds in excess of 23mph. - Began his youth career in the slightly longer 400m, of which he has a PB of 45.28. The question is at what distance would endurance vs. speed balance out and Kipchoge vs. Bolt produce a 5/10 race for both athletes? Just to get some numbers out there I would guess around 600m, the second lap would be an absolute killer for Bolt and any longer he will be completely gassed, any shorter and Bolts sprint background will be enough for him to stay ahead. Bonus question At your chosen distance both are given one year to properly train for the race, who wins now?","My answer is a 600m race. We had a very similar post a few years asking Mo Farah vs Usain Bolt where I argued that 500m is the shortest distance Mo Farah can win against Bolt But Farah runs more 5k and 10k races, and previously 3k. He has a competitive 800m on his record. Kipchoge has never competed at such a short distance, so for him 600m seems more reasonable than 500m. 400m is something Bolt has run and is still considered a ""sprint"". 600m is the shortest distance considered ""middle-distance"" implying the necessity of pacing throughout the race. I don't think Lipchoge can compete on anything shorter than that."

"argumenta sobre: The Rebels have dropped John Carpenter's the Thing into the Death Star. The Thing starts off by assimilating a regular Stormtrooper. Can it successfully assimilate all imperial personnel on the Death Star before they can contain and destroy the illusive alien? Assume that the force can sense something's off with an assimilated person, but only if the force user is within 20 feet of them. Round 1: Regular Death Star security and staff, and Grand Moff Tarkin is there as well Round 2: Darth Vader is patrolling the station as well. Round 3: In addition to Vader, Palpatine and the his Royal Guard are also on the station. Bonus round: The Thing's assimilation is going on while Luke and his crew are trying to rescue Leia.","Honestly, once Vade, maybe even Tarkin realized what was going on, they'd be more than willing to seal off a wide perimeter around the infected and open it to space, killing all the personnel in the area, and then after sealing it back up and restoring atmosphere, come back in with flamethrower troopers to toast anything still moving. Part of what made it difficult for the people in the original movie to stop the infection was their unwillingness to kill their friends and/or sacrifice uninfected people. The Empire would not give a shit."

Who would die first, who would be the last man standing? All feats are allowed e.g. we're going by Voldemort in both the books and movies. Note, for all rounds: I'm going to say that Fire Lord Ozai is under the influence of Sozin's Comet since that's the only time we see him fight. Round 1: They duke it out using all their weapons, powers and invulnerabilities presented to them. Round 2: Same as round 1, only we remove the invulnerabilities they possess. So, in other words, Voldemort's Horcruxes are gone, you don't need to toss the One Ring into Mt. Doom, you don't need dragonglass to kill the Night King and Ganondorf's and the White Witch's immortality is removed. They're all perfectly mortal. Would that actually change anything? Round 3: Same as round 1, only now they have the full might of their respective armies backing them up. Once again, Ozai's Fire Nation is under the influence of Sozin's Comet. Round 4: Same as round 2, only with the armies backing them up once again.","I feel like Sideous at his prime would beat them all. He was a master at all seven forms of lightsaber combat and could wield two lightsabers simultaneously against two opponents Maul and Savage. He was THE master of the Dark Side and was the most powerful Sith Lord to exist in thousands of years. In addition, he was an expert politician and plotter which allowed him to start a civil war in the galaxy and make the public cheer for him as he took on more and more power. And considering his army consists of the Death Star I think he could definitely best any of the other ""dark lords""."

The first movie also shows that he can scare adults just as well as Sully and Mike did in MU, perhaps even better, so he has that going for him R3: Shrek wins with the advantage simply because his movie is a comedy and Monsters Inc. isn't, at least not as much BR: Shrek, did you see that one scene in the knights tournament, or the one in Fairy Godmothers factory?

If he tries to choke someone or an animal by locking their neck, he can virtually feel the neck and choke it with his hands/arms.

argumenta sobre: 5 people with no legs vs 5 people with no arms Round 1: In an empty flat field the armed group have wooden clubs and the legged group have steel toe capped boots.

First to carry all coconuts win.edit: no throwing/kicking allowed Round 4: With no experience and 24 hours practice they need to perform the better dance number to a pro judge. Round 5: Both teams have the latest prosthetic technology to replace their missing limbs. No weapons other than that.,"Round 1: The legs group can run, jump, have a longer reach, and the heads of the arms group are just the perfect height for a good kick. I give it to them 6/10 because the arms group have more dexterity and they can always grab onto the legs and beat them to death. Round 2: ""Anakin, I have the high ground!"" Also it's possible to rip of branches and use those as weapons. Round 3: Arms group can throw the coconuts more accurately. Round 4: No idea. Round 5: I'll assume they have been working out their respective body parts, otherwise this is just two groups of people whaling on each other. In that case, the arms group can do more things with their arms than the legs group can do with their legs, so they win 6/10."

"argumenta sobre: A T-800 replaces Frodo as the Ring Bearer. Starting from the Shire, can it get the One Ring into Mount Doom? Round 1: A factory default T-800. Its only directive is to get the ring into the volcano. The Fellowship will try to help it, but they can not reason with it or explain why simply walking into Mordor is a bad idea. If they get in the way, the T-800 will register them as enemies. It does not understand stealth or tactics. Can it make the journey without getting stopped by magic, cave trolls, or simply overwhelming numbers of Orcs and Uruk-Hai? Round 2: Arnold's well-educated T-101 from Terminator 2. It appears human, can converse semi-normally with humanoid races, and does understand stealth and tactics. It will also be far more willing to work with the Fellowship. Round 3: Same as above, but its directive is to protect Frodo at all costs and follow his orders to the letter. Instead of replacing Frodo, it replaces the Fellowship. It can not take the ring from Frodo. Bonus Round: Round 1 but it's a T-1000.","Probably helpful to look at what in Middle Earth is physically powerful enough to do a T-800 serious harm: Mumakil/Oliphaunt Cave Troll Olog-Hai Armoured Troll Balrog Various assorted artillery pieces Saruman magic only Gandalf magic only Dragons fire only And a couple which might badly impede it but aren't reliable: The Watcher can certainly grab and eat a T-800, but it probably bursts it's way out Shelob can probably incap it temporarily, but certainly can't kill it Rohirim Lance-point multiple piercing hits will degrade it, each impact probably kills the rider and horse The Witch King, with Fell Beast and massive flail Finally, a few human-sized fighters which might be able to take a few chunks out of it or temporarily hold it up but have no chance individually: Aragorn Uruk Hai Berserkers Uruk and Ork captains Lurtz, etc The Nine So, although a T-800 is far tougher than any member of the Fellowship, it's not infallible. For example, if it follows the route Frodo took, it doesn't even survive FotR - either the Cave Troll or the Balrog destroys it. That said, it can choose a different route. R1: 2/10. It equips a heavy steel bow and sword. It bypasses Moria by taking the high pass, at which point the Fellowship can't follow. Saruman's crows track it, and Lurtz's company is sent to kill it. It fights them off, but sustains injuries - it's peppered with arrows, a bit dented, etc. It makes for Mordor, attempting to climb the mountains. It isn't trying to hide, so it suffers relentless attack by orks, the nine. Once it reaches the plains of Mordor, it gets punched around by dozens of trolls for hours until it's shaken to pieces. 2/10 just in case by some miracle it happens to avoid being spotted. R2: 9/10. Travels with the Fellowship, but due to it's abilities they are more successful, Gandalf still lost, Boromir doesn't try to take the ring, Fellowship doesn't split. Galdriel's gift to the Terminator is a Phased Plasma Rifle in the 40 Watt range. This is then used to dispatch anything and everything which gets in their way. R3: Either 6/10 or 0/10. If it has to always obey Frodo's orders, it's a 0 because Frodo won't destroy the Ring in Mount Doom, and the Terminator will have already killed Gollum. If the Terminator is allowed to disobey him once just to destroy the Ring, it's a 6/10. That's an improvement on the 3/10 I'd give Frodo in the actual story, because it reliably protects him more effectively than Sam, and Frodo's good-sense removes most of it's own weaknesses."

Round 2: The grizzly is bloodlusted and he is wearing full riot gear, however the Rocks now have 3 Prime Mike Tysons with aluminium baseball bats. They also have an extra Conor McGregor wearing brass knuckles and bloodlusted.","The sheer and freakish powe of a grizzly bear would be too much for 4 Dwayne Johnsons to handle. Add to that the blood lust, and it would easily overpower the group of Johnsons. Grizzly Bears are massively strong, agile, and muscularly dense as well as having very strong skeletons. The baseball bats strikes, even from an aluminum bat, would just enrage it more. If all the Rocks could offensively corner him in such a way as to be all hitting him simultaneously with their aluminium bats - with the swings timed only a few seconds apart and in all the right places - then maybe. The chances of that happening are slim to none, even with 1 month prep. Why? As soon as the bear started displaying his alpha posturing, which is as much of an offensive maneuver for them as it is defensive, at least half of the Dwayne Johnsons would collapse in fear. They would cower out to defensive positions. The 2 that are left attacking assuming they are still advancing at this point would likely be charged at. Then it would be an absolute massacre; tossed about like rag dolls, being beaten/pummeled/clawed, and quite possibly ripped to shreds arms torn off, etc..

Let's say that in the 2008 Hulk film, Abomination wounds Hulk much more grievously to the point that, though he still wins, Hulk dies of his injuries shortly afterward. How would this change the rest of the MCU going forward? Can the surviving cast still manage to win in their films?","Without Hulk, Loki probably escapes after Avengers and isn't captured, which means Thor 2 goes very differently. Jane probably dies, which impacts nothing directly except perhaps reducing Thor's ties to Earth. It's possible that the Aether is then contained by Odin, but the Dark Elves continue being a threat. Odin keeps the Aether and the Tesseract on Asgard as long as someone is actively trying to collect the stones. It's also possible he uses the power of both stones to destroy the Dark Elves in revenge for the death of Frigga. Without Loki mindwiping him, Odin possibly also doesn't die when he does, meaning Hela isn't released, meaning Asgard isn't destroyed, meaning Thanos may not start collecting the stones when he does, and the whole timeline goes sideways. On the other hand, with Loki loose, we really don't know what he'd do. He's Loki."

"argumenta sobre: Can Iron Man build a suit to defeat these characters? Tony Stark is transported to several different universes, in each universe, he identifies one being that wields great power, and he wants to be ready if he needs to put them down. In each universe, he's given 6 months to create a suit of armor specifically suited to kill or incapacitate his target. He can use any objects or materials native to that universe to build his suit. He may NOT use one of his pre-existing armors. The armor he builds can be powered by his arc reactor, if he can't find anything stronger to power it. Tony is given basic knowledge on each character in addition to whatever he canonically knows about them. He can choose to do research on his target, but that will eat out of his time to build his suit. Let's meet the line-up. Kratos, the God of War Notable Items: Asgardian Ingots, Yggdrasil's Dews, Resurrection Stones Mario, the Jumpman Notable Items: Safety Badge, Ice Flower, Super Mushroom Mickey Mouse, the Face of the Most Magical Place on Earth Notable Items: Gummiberry Juice, Thinner, Dip Mewtwo, the Ultimate Lifeform Notable Items: Poké Balls, Potions, Muscle Band The Doctor, the Last Time Lord Notable Items: Gallifreyan Zinc, Cyberman Tech, Dalek Tech Win Condition: Tony builds a suit that can kill, restrain, or knock out his opponent.

"argumenta sobre: Harry Potter on his broomstick vs. the Green Goblin on his glider The Goblin starts attacking Muggles near the Leaky Cauldron to draw Harry out, because he knows Harry is there. Norman: ""Can Harry Potter come out to play?"" Harry: ""I've seen scarier goblins than you at Gringotts."" Harry is 18, post Deathly Hallows. Win by KO, incapacitation or death. Harry is able to get into the air before the fight begins, so they're on an even footing. He has his wand but not his invisibility cloak.","Harry Potter has a few one hit kills. In theory he could cast the killing curse however the text says you have to mean to kill for the Killing Curse to work fake Madeye Moody says if every student in the class tried it he might get a nose bleed. He struggled with casting the torture curse when he was wanting Bealitrix to feel pain for killing Sirius Black, so I doubt he could muster the will power to kill a complete stranger. Even if Harry shoots the spell, it does not have instant travel time. Fawkes intercepted one shot, and Dumbledore threw several statues in the ways of others during the ministry fight. Harry has never presented beyond human levels reactions before, outside of being a better seeker than most other wizards, but the Goblin has shown the ability to react much faster. He has dodged magical beam attacks and blitzed a guard pointing a gun at him so should be able to dodge any killing spell Harry fires. Other spells would be a no go. Sectumsempra could do a lot of damage but he has survived getting impaled in the chest by his own glider so should be able to shrug off the massive bleeding for a time. Mind control might work although it can be beaten through sufficient will power and Osborn has fought off mind control before Disarming spell won't do much as much if Goblin's weapons are in his suit, and he can remotely control his glider if separated. Harry's best bet would be to try to activate one of Goblin's bombs, although he has survived his own pumpkin bomb explosions, but I do not recall ""hightechus explodicus"" being a spell. Norman could kill Harry in all kinds of ways, and I do not think the power of love protects from a glider stabbing you through the back."

Hawaii declares independence, and the entire US Navy and coast guard decide to guarantee it's independence. They are prepared to fight without pay. The US government orders the armed forces to take Hawaii back whatever it takes short of nuclear war. -The Navy had two weeks advance warning, allowing them to supply their ships and leave potentially hostile ports. -They were also able to expel all non -naval personal from Hawaii prior to the announcement. -The US Navy is allowed to keep their ports and facilities elsewhere assuming they can hold them. -The Navy was able to transfer the families and love ones of it's member to Hawaii prior to the announcement. -All US allies stay neutral unless provoked, they consider it an internal matter. - Other countries, are allowed to trade or offer other support to the new island nation if they consider it is in their interest and worth the consequences. - The Navy is allowed to invade other countries of they wish, but normal consequences apply.","Considering Hawaii imports its food, gas and oil and many other important things, it would be a matter of time, depending on import and coming in from someone like China.

If he guesses it, you lose the power and you have to fight him barehanded. What power can let you win? Rules: - Batman/Bruce will simply be in his underwear with no weapons or armor. You can wear your regular street clothes if you like. - To avoid him instantly speedblitzing you, you start at opposite ends of a football field. - He can ask any question he wants, and will be doing his best to whittle down entire categories by asking things like ""will it let you hit me from a distance?"" or ""will it affect my ability to perceive you?"" or ""if a 10-year old had this power, is there a reasonable chance that YOU could beat him?"". - He gets 3 minutes to prepare a strategy before asking the first question, then 30 seconds after your answers to ask each additional question. - His guess needs to be pretty close, but it doesn't have to be exact. He needs to have the basic ideas behind your powers down, but doesn't need to have the exact incidental details. If you choose ""Spawning 143 northeastern bald faced hornets per second out of my left hand"" as your power, and he guesses that you can summon or generate stinging insects, that's a win for him. - If he doesn't get your power within 20 guesses, his memory of the conversation will be erased to keep him from deducing which powers you do or don't have, and all he'll know is that he needs to incapacitate you. - Should go without saying, but you have to answer honestly. Edit - I specified in the title that the power is for the fight. I'll clarify that that means you don't get the power while you're being questioned by him. Otherwise you could obviously just take 'person deleting powers' and obliterate him the second you both sit down.","Something eclectic.. weird and unexpected seems to be way to win. But depends how exact he has to be? If my power was to cause Batman's fingers and toes to suddenly weigh 40 tons each when I said the word 'daffodil' is it enough for him to guess that my power involves restricting movement or does he have to be waay more specific Or if my power was to equalise us in some way, like by averaging us both out to match each other, is it enough for him to guess the power will somehow weaken him and strengthen me honestly this wouldn't be a bad idea for some kind of game night scenario.

Plus, as they master more languages, they'll get better at learning them and be able to use their experience with one to help with others IE all the romance languages have many similarities. I don't think it's terribly unrealistic that once they hit their stride, they could master 2-3 languages per year. The biggest roadblocks would be their parents potentially cutting them off since they do nothing but study languages all day and refuse to go to actual school / get a job, and tracking down the material needed to master extinct languages.

argumenta sobre: 10 Protoss colossiStarcraft2 vs 500 M1 Abrams tanks The colossi are lore-based vs 500 modern M1 Abrams on a plain battlefield 500 meters apart.,"it depends on the interaction between the colossi plasma shields and the 120mm bore cannons. an experienced M1 crew can fire 8 to 12 rounds per minute, with an effective range of 3 km. Range in SC is hard to determine, and collosi are anti infantry units, but in game, they fire at about 2/3 the range of a siege tank so it's safe to assume they can fire at approximately the same range as the Abrams. The protoss in SC2 have updated their shields. They don't regenerate under fire anymore, but they regenerate faster while not sustaining damage. Another advantage the colossi have is that they never miss thanks to their advanced AI targeting systems, and their plasma shields would melt the Abrams in one hit. That's like 100 tanks melted per 10 colossi salvo. 500 is still a lot of tanks. if the colossi fight in any terrain that isn't an open field, they would win, especially if they can bottle neck the tanks. in an open field, the Abrams should win, as they can more easily spread out, surround, and avoid being aoe targeted."

With 12 being the minimum age to enter the Hunger Games, Percy is dropped into the 74th Games in place of Katniss rather than being sent off on his quest to recover Zeus' lightning bolt. He is armed with Riptide from the start but has no other supplies. Can his at this stage largely un-trained powers compensate for his lack of experience and age enough for him to win the Games?","Assuming riptide works on mortals, and assuming hes willing to kill the other tributes, he should win pretty easily, assuming no cheating by the gamemakers. Sure he only has a few weeks of training, but that's more than the rest of the tributes, minus the careers. Before leaving for his quest, he won fights against Luke and Clarissa, who were two of the best fighters in camp, and beat the Minotaur. He should also be stronger and faster than everyone else, despite being smaller and younger. Most half bloods naturally have some degree of enhanced physicals. If he finds a water source, it's game over. Water gives him a healing factor, enhanced physicals, and ranged attacks. His biggest weakness is his lack of survivalist training. If he can't find food, he'd probably have to attack the career base to take their's, and there's a solid chance he dies to the land mines.

"argumenta sobre: Could humans survive a cordinated ant uprising? As you might know, ants have either the same biomass as we have , or even higher than we do. This gives a question, could a organised ant uprising succeed, and what would be their best course of action? The rules are \- Humans are unaware of ant uprising, until it is undeniable few humans dying here and there is not enought, it needs to be entire villages being wiped of the map \- Worker ants have standard inteligence They can not build tools outside of those that they could resonably use, but due to trial and error they could for example figure out how to either chew cables or clog engines \- Logistics still apply for both ants and humans - Ants still have to eat, they can not just teleport across the continent - They could use either captured human food, small animals or even dead humans as sustenance, so it is not hopeless \- Each ant queen gains the ability to communicate with other ant queens, and they have inteligence of a person - This is the only 100% fantasy rule","I think it depends on a lot of factors. Exactly how smart the ants are, and how patient they are. If their approach is all-out aggression, they lose. However, if ants could somehow learn to use computers not sure how they could easily infiltrate ANY secure area on Earth, learn any password, and then hack/manipulate their way into any system, giving them massive power over things like power plants, military, food supply, and more. Even without computers, ants if smart enough could possibly gain cultlike devotion from traitor humans and use them as sleeper agents. Imagine ants, who find a way to write/talk to humans, identifying malleable humans and promising them something in exchange for... whatever they want. ""Drive 1 million of us in a car to Washington DC, and we will give you the passwords to any person's login to any website you want.""

argumenta sobre: Mace Windu vs Count Dooku They start 20 ft apart. Who wins? Edit: Round 1: Canon Mace vs Canon Dooku Round 2: Legends Mace vs Legends Dooku,"Probably as close to a 50/50 draw as you can get in Legends. Mace was amped against Sidious because Sidious tends to let loose with tons of Dark Side energy when he fights. Dooku is much more reserved as a swordsman/with his Dark Side powers, so Mace won't have anything but Vaapad's merits as a sword style to fall back on. Canon it's probably Mace with high difficulty. Dooku never shows anything that puts him above Palpatine as a swordsman, who Mace ""beat"" there's some ambiguity on whether Palpatine threw the fight due to sensing Anakin's arrival straight up. At the very least Mace was good enough to give Sidious a long, protracted fight that pushed Sidious to the upper boundaries of his skill as a swordsman."

That's definitely too many for the Marine to take in the jungle because they're likely going to be coming from all directions, swinging down from above, coming from behind brush and trees. Chimps will just bum rush him and then he's fucked. He could probably pick off like 10 of them before he gets pummeled. Now if it was an open field and the chimps are all like 300 yards away, then things would get interesting. He would pick a ton of them off but he would still need to reload, giving the chimps time to close the distance. He basically needs to get at least 100 shots off with all perfect accuracy on moving targets. I bet a SEAL or highly trained operator could get it done but I think it would still be too many for a Marine unless he had infinite ammo and could just fire shots like a maniac.

If agent 47 got contracted to take out Batman Bruce Wayne do you think he has a chance against or he will successfully complete the mission?,"As great as Agent 47 is, it wouldn't be the first time an obscenely skilled assassin tried to ice Batman. Comics Batman may as well be superhuman with all of the stuff he's done. I don't think Agent 47 can sneak up on him, and the moment Bats sees him, his Batman senses will tingle, and he'll be ready. The only way Agent 47 can take this is via sniper rifle, and even then, comics Batman will cheese his way out of it. DCAU Batman, by the time he reaches the JL season, also takes this. BatB Batman Silver Ages 47's ass. I'd argue that most animated Batmen survive this encounter. Arkham Batman does Arkham Batman shit. The irl Batman would have the most difficulty. Pattinson is dead. Bale is also dead, but he has slightly better odds than Pattinson. Keaton-verse Batman is probably dead because not being able to turn his head does him no favors, but maybe Keaton between the 90s movies and the Flash peaked somewhere and was strong enough.

Now Bond finds himself hunted by the High Table, the secretive council that controls the assassin world. How do you think Bond would handle this? Could his spy skills and gadgets give him an edge or would the High Table's assassins overwhelm him? For this scenario, the Bond in question, is Timothy Dalton's version, reimagined as a 28-year-old MI6 agent who has been trained by both Gene Lebell and Jean Claude Van Damme, with special expertise in disappearing without a trace. Oh, and Dalton's Bond is armed with Q branch technology plus a Walther PPK that is only tailored to his fingerprint.","So not hunted by Wick himself, but by the High Table so basically put in Wick's shoes during the events of the films. Short answer is probably not. Wick made it through a combination of being an unstoppable killing machine and leveraging key connections/favors in that world. Bonds skills are more suited to spy craft / getting intel / exploiting character flaws of his enemies, and working as part of a broader team; he's not suited to brute force sustained combat on his own and he's rarely the most dangerous person in any given story.

Steve is a 31 year old HR worker from Pennsylvania who hates it when you confuse him with the NFL player of the same name. His hobbies include going to the gym once per month in half-hearted attempts to drop from an overweight BMI to a healthy weight BMI and attempting DIY projects before giving up and hiring someone to clean up his shoddy work. He was married briefly in his mid 20's, but she divorced him and his attempts at online dating since then have been lackluster at best.

R2: All supers present in sekovia minus Hawkeye and Black Widow yet again. R3: every super who fought Thanos at some point in IW. No one has any knowledge of SCP-682's abilities or nature beforehand, battle occurs at noon on each of the respective film's largest battlefields NYC, Sekovia, and the Wakandan field. All fighters are in prime condition. No prep time. Win condition is near permanent incapacitation, preferably banishment or death for 682, with the latter simply needing to kill or incapacitate all of the characters in each fight. BONUS ROUND: R3 but all have basic knowledge of 682's abilities and nature, with Banner, Stark and Strange all having spent weeks researching every bit of info they have on him before prep time shuri can help too. 2 week prep time for all fighters save 682. EXTREME BONUS ROUND: Same as bonus, but all characters other than 682 are at 3X their current abilities and bloodlusted, have the assistance of doctors Bright, Kondraki, Clef, and Gears, along with MTF Omega-7. 682 teleports straight onto the battlefield after a nice long soak in his acid bath 50% mass.

Avengers win by BFR. In the bonus round they have a chance. Tony Stark would be ready with various fire/freeze/acid projectors. Strange would be ready with appropriate spells. Shuri can probably create a vibranium cage or something. The Avengers should be able to incapacitate or imprison SCP 682. If it eats someone Strange is the vulnerable one here, then they might be in trouble. Bonus round 2 they have an even better chance, and can easily incapacitate the lizard. It can't be killed.

Can they manage? Edit: we are gonna ignore starvation and that kind of stuff because it very much just isn't fun. Edit 2: people took this post as a humanity VS a giant crab when all I really wanted to know what would happen if it spawned in the ocean and woke up. The bonus Round is humanity vs giant crab but not the whole post itself.,If we scale the crab's shell then i don't think humanity can do anything to hurt it. Once it wakes up it'll probably want to feed and would snack on whales and other similar sized marine animals The damage it'll do to humanity would be more on animal instincts and less of pure evil so we just have to learn to live with a Germany-sized crab.

"argumenta sobre: WW2: Nazi Germany with respawning soldiers vs the Soviet Union How would these two powers match against each other if the Nazis had a re-spawning system in place for their soldiers? This ability would have several ground rules; 1. Every German soldier that dies in combat respawns at the nearest German Army Base 2. The respawn ability is only limited to 1 time per soldier. This means that the ´respawned´ soldiers cannot respawn again, as they have already used the one-time respawn ability. 3. The soldier respawns with all their equipment/weaponry intact, also removing their previous equipment from the battlefield. 4. If larger units get wiped out together ie. a German tank & whole the crew gets taken out at the same time, they respawn with their tanks intact aswell. Of course this assumes that all the soldiers in the tank have their one-time ´respawn´ ability ready. 5. German High command are aware of this ability, and can plan their military tactics/strategies accordingly. Meanwhile the Soviets remain completely unaware of this at all times. Suppose Operation Barbarossa starts as usual in June 1941, but Germany can solely focus on it, without France/the UK/the US to worry about. R1: Aforementioned rules; zero outside interference, just Germany and the USSR. R2: Soviet Union gets the Lend Lease program help from the US. Italy helps Germany. Also the German soldiers now have 2 respawns per soldier. R3: Same as round 2 but the German soldiers are now bloodlusted.","I think one of the biggest reasons Germany wins this is morale. According to the prompt, German high command are aware of the respawn ability. They will quickly and loudly ensure all their troops know about it, too. A major issue in any conscript war is conditioning soldiers to actually want to fight, to overcome the fear of death, etc. If Germany can promise AND DEMONSTRATE to their soldiers they can't die, it will be VERY EASY to convince men to take on suicidal, heroic efforts knowing they are 100% safe, at least once. Hell, Germany can conscript every woman and child for a single life of duty, knowing they are risking ZERO to their long term population. They could encourage brutal kamikaze tactics, strapping bombs and chemical weapons to kids, etc with no risk. If the Germans are very smart, they can even use this ability for purposes other than sheer attrition. You could, for instance, send a soldier ahead as a spy or as deep recon on what would normally be a suicide mission. Instead, personnel can now traverse FAR deeper into enemy territory and cities for intelligence without having to figure out how to get home or get their findings back to base. Get secrets from deep within enemy territory Take a cyanide pill Respawn at base with the intel in your mind, transmitting it FASTER THAN LIGHTSPEED across an entire continent Also, the prompt says Russia isn't aware of the ability during the fight, but I don't see how that's possible. Because Germany would surely publicize this via propaganda, etc. Capture some prisoners, have THEM kill a German soldier and show them THE MEN THEY KILLED RESPAWNING. ""Go tell your leaders, the Aryan race cannot be killed."" Massive strike on enemy morale if even a whisper of this is believed."

With no other lore left to solve, except for Petscop but who the hell could ever solve that, Mat turns his attention to the one lore worth solving: the identity of the Zodiac Killer. He plans to expose the identity of the famous killer through the only means he knows how, Theory videos on YouTube. He will not goof around, like the whole Ness/Sans incident, but will give his true intellect and dedication to his work, as if it were the work of Cawthon himself. How many clickbait-y YouTube videos will it take to uncover the real purple guy, The Zodiac Killer? R1: MatPat is taken to the late 1960's, to piece together this murder spree. MatPat has access to the future internet to post oddly edited videos, correspond with his team/commenters, and research, but no one else can. He has access to all information on the Zodiac Killer that is available, and everyone is compliant with his work. MatPat can't interact with his future victims, directly witness the killer, or prevent their death. R2: R1 but the Zodiac Killer knows about MatPat, and his use of research to stop him, as well as his ability to use the internet/crowdsource info R3: R1 but the Zodiac Killer must confirm at least 2 of Mats Theories™️ R4: the Zodiac Killer forgets all of his previous targets and attacks MatPat directly. MatPat knows this, but must still expose him. Can he do it, edit, and upload the final video before dying?","Well matpat is a rather smart individual but he doesn't strike me as a detective, he seems more like a speculator than a straight up detective. He can research but that won't always stop his videos from being more fiction based than fact based. I would be willing to bet he might pin-point someone as being the zodiac killer in about 1000-10,000 videos if he went full conspiracy nut in R1 solely because of his use of the internet and his research and whatnot, but I doubt it would be the actual zodiac killer unless he is lucky. Like I said, he's smart but he is more ""find an answer no matter what"" then he is ""find an answer based in fact"" which in modern day works fine because it's just fun speculation and an interesting take on video games, but for this prompt that doesn't pan out too well. Maybe he would take away his ""answer at all costs"" knowing what's at stake, or maybe that would cause him to try even harder to leap in logic toward an answer but still the odds don't look great. R2-R4 he is probably killed only because a guy with a gun can be an effective killer in almost any circumstance, the internet doesn't make you bullet proof unfortunately. In R3 again if he is lucky maybe he could get a theory confirmed if he researched enough but I doubt it would be a straight ""this is the guy"" theory. They had a very skilled detective on the case and he didn't figure this out in the slightest, and we're looking at a man who just goes for the theories so it doesn't bode too well. That's my two cents anyway"

"argumenta sobre: The Eastern Front but Taylor Swift replaces Joseph Stalin and Kanye West replaces Adolf Hitler, who wins? It is September 13th, 15 years ago Kanye West had ruined Taylor Swift's once in a lifetime moment at the VMAs. Now 15 years have passed and Round 2 will commence. We go back in time to September 13, 1939. World War 2 has just started but there is a twist. Adolf Hitler is replaced with Kanye West and Joseph Stalin is replaced with Taylor Swift. This is done Quantum Leap style where people look at 'Stalin' or 'Hitler' and they visually look normal, but mentally and personality wise they're obviously different people. They still retain their respective historical figures' knowledge of politics and warfare but they have the personalities of either Taylor Swift/Kanye West, which is the main factor as to how this changes the Eastern Front. For example, 'Hitler' AKA Kanye still has his addiction to nitrous oxide and Taylor Swift has her addiction with flying on private planes. Round 1: Both in character, 'present day' versions of both so yes, Kanye has his current... 'Beliefs' as the two start off in 1939 with their respective nations the Soviet Union and Third Reich. Round 2: FDR is replaced with Pete Davidson and Mussolini is replaced with Drake. How does this affect things?",Considering that Taylor swift has the lend lease so basically US funded and she seems less likley to kill her generals or advisors like Stalin did and actually listen to them I don't think kanye could make it to swiftgrad stalingrad
"argumenta sobre: How long would it take Ancient Rome to make a Big Mac? In 98 AD, every individual within the Roman Empire is given an obsecely long document listing off exactly how to produce a McDonald's Big Mac. This includes the exact locations of the plants needed to produce the Burger's ingredients, how to properly process them, and how to construct the machinery needed to create the burger. Every person within the Roman Empire is convinced it is their state's ultimate goal to create this Big Mac. No matter the leadership of Rome or status of the state, their goal will remain unchanged they will still fight wars to protect their territory and resources however if needed.","It depends on how strict you want your Big Mac to be. \- \- Not Strict: You the idea of a Big Mac, but it doesn't have to be exactly exact. \-- You can do this I'd say in a few decades, maybe 100 years. Wheat was domesticated in the fertile crescent, cows are old world animals and you can make cheese with them, you can get cucumbers from India, make vinegar from wine, trade through the silk road for sesame seeds, etc... With the knowledge of HOW to make all of the ingredients and the locations, that won't be difficult. The issue will be tomatoes. Tomatoes are New World plants. The Roman Empire will have to develop a new method of seafaring to make it across the ocean and trade with the natives for tomatoes to slice for the burger and to make ketchup for the Big Mac Sauce. \- \- Strict: You want a Big Mac, an EXACT Big Mac. Exact ingredients, exact preparations, exact taste. \-- This might take a few hundred years. You'll need to AT LEAST wait a few thousand of generations of genetically modified wheat/tomatoes/cucumbers/lettuce to get the right varieties to have the same taste. They'll have to invent the industrial milling and refining process for white sugar to get the right taste in the ketchup. The cheese is made by blending melted cheeses with sodium citrate and other chemicals, then letting it cool in a flat sheet and cutting it to size. They'll have to invent industrialization and a few different kinds of science to get all the ingredients to perfectly match. \- \- \- EDIT: I've been informed that Big Macs don't actually have any tomatoes in them, and I have realized i was wrong. You don't have to go to the New World for Tomatoes, but you do have to go to the New World for Paprika and cornstarch"

"argumenta sobre: The Vatican is given notice of Paimon's Cult targeting the Grahams, can they save them?Hereditary Part of the tragedy of Hereditary is how the Grahams' fate was pretty much decided before the movie even started, with the grandmother leading the cult and essentially raising her children and grandchildren to be sacrifices for Paimon. However, what if the Vatican/Catholic Church was given notice of the cultists activities before certain time frames? Could the Church have saved them from their fate, using the occult knowledge and possibly even firepower to do so. For the sake of the challenge, the Church is allowed harm/kill people only in self defense, e.g. a cultists or possessed person tries to attack them.

R2: The Crab is just straight up powerless here, in any given situation. First off, i'll assume you mean the... aforementioned MCU version of Mjolnir. This version of Mjolnir is crazy powerful, and the Crab is finished in a few hits. Assuming the Crab doesn't hit the Elephant with the gun first, Crab looses. If we're talking COMIC Mjolnir, Crab's really screwed, possibly more than before. If you mean the Mjolnir of Norse legend, the Crab. Will not. Last. A second. This thing can level mountains in a single goddamn swing. Don't fuck with mythological Thor. Elephant wins 10/10, 10/10, and like, 100/10 on the last one. R3: Thanos, in the comics at least, isn't too terribly powerful compared to comic Darkseid. He has all kinds of stuff though. Super strength, INSANE LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE, Telekinesis, but in the end, Darkseid is far superior to him. Even with ""The Infinity Gauntlet"" that everyone has lost their collective minds over, Darkseid Elephant wins 10/10, every time.

"argumenta sobre: Lex Luthor gets his deepest wish. He's teleported to the world of ""The Boys"". Can he take down ""The Seven"" and Homelander? Its Lex Luthor's wet dream. A world where ""Superman"" is an amoral prick and he's right, that's also a capitalist paradise for him. So Lex vs The Seven. Lex is sent in with no money and only his wits. He doesn't even have clothes. Can he: A Build up Lex Corp there? B Kill Homelander and mount his head on his wall C Set up his own Super Identity or Team in place of ""The Seven"". Can be him or not, his preference. D Get the loving adoration of the public.","Luthor is a supergenius. He'd be able to start his own company and build it up till he could just buy Vought himself. Also, Lex is used to much stronger foes, he'd definitely figure how to kill most of the seven seeing how most of them will die if shot in the head. Furthermore, homelander is not as strong as Superman, a nuke will kill him as well as uranium bullets. Worst case scenario Lex becomes president and nukes Homelander. Best case he makes some fancy bullets and hires an assassin. Since Superpowers are made in this universe Luthor would probably be able to reverse engineer it or create his own. He could definitely get the love of the public with good PR"

I know he can't beat up an elephant but I can't articulate why... Please prove him wrong and convince him that he's a moron.

"argumenta sobre: Character Scramble Season 19: Final Destination Voting is live! Click HERE to vote for the winner of the season, who will be crowned on May 28th, 11:59PM PST. --- The Character Scramble is a long-running writing prompt tournament in which participants submit characters from fiction to a specified tier and guideline. After the submission period ends, the submitted characters are ""scrambled"" and randomly distributed to each writer, forming their team for the season. Writers will then be entered into a single-elimination bracket, where they write a story that features their team fighting against their opponent's team. Victors are decided based on reader votes; in other words, if you want people to vote for you, write some good content. The winner by votes of each match-up moves on to the next round. The pattern continues until only one participant remains: the new Character Scramble champion, who gets to choose the theme, tier, and rules of the next Scramble! The theme of Character Scramble 19 is Super Smash Bros. Round prompts will be based on the many Nintendo franchises represented in Smash, along with some of its third party offerings. --- Hub Post Rosters Join the email list! Join the Character Scramble Discord! --- AUDI FANAAAAAAAAAAM You're finally here. You stand on the precipice of the world you've sworn to save. You've made strong allies, faced powerful foes, braved vistas terrible and sublime. Indeed, you've done well to come this far. Victory, and the salvation of your world, is within reach. But just as you reach out to grasp your prize, it extends away from you. Hundreds of crystal steps sprawl into distant space, into a swirling nexus of worlds. One final sprint. THE GREAT MAZE Time is of the essence. The enemy team is making their final moves, and each of you have a lot of ground to cover. Make your way through the stages, overcome the challenges within, and emerge victorious. Be warned though, that not everyone can make it through. As you progress through the Great Maze, your characters will fall one by one, until the last one standing is crowned. There will be no stage select, no bans and counter picks. You will be making your way through all of these prompts. After all, the best sets always go to five. As you take your first steps into the maze, you're greeted by glaring sunlight. Rolling hills and checkerboard patterns sprawl into the distance as palm trees sprout from the verdant earth. You feel the pull of gravity as you approach a slope that leads into… is that a loop-de-loop? STAGE 1: GREEN HILL ZONE As you try to make sense of the twisting paths, however, the enemy team arrives. Suddenly, you feel time itself attack. What you're doing here isn't a normal fight— it's a race. You're Too Slow! This match is a race to the end of the zone. The last ones past the goal post are the first ones eliminated. Green Hill's Looking a Lot More Like Sand Hill! Of course, Green Hill Zone is notoriously overplayed. If you wish to set the race on the deserts of Tatooine or through the mountains of Mordor, by all means. What matters is that you race to win. As you pass the goalpost, the checkerboards dissipate and the grass grows wild. Clouds hover just above, so close you could touch them, and the crests of great cliffs tower in the distance. STAGE 2: GAUR PLAIN The ground beneath you trembles. You look up and see a giant approaching you, ready to fight on behalf of the opposing team. But, big as that baddie is, you can't shake the feeling you might be fighting on something even bigger… You Will Know Our Names: You've stumbled into an area that's way above your level. Not all of your teammates are making it out in one piece. The Bionis and Mechonis: It's giants all the way down. You're not only fighting against a titan, but you are fighting atop even bigger giants, locked in the aftermath of their battle. Describe this setting. For both of these, you can choose whatever giants best fit your setting. However, as it is the 10th anniversary, you are strongly encouraged to take a look at the titans of the past… After slaying the giant, blue skies and green grass give way to stormy clouds and barren wastes. You trudge through the night, until at long last, atop an imposing mountain, backlit by the full moon, you see…. STAGE 3: DRACULA'S CASTLE An ancient evil, once thought to be vanquished, casts their gaze towards you. They seek revenge for their vanquishment, and are even willing to work with the enemy team to ensure they enact their toll… A Terrible Night For a Curse: You will face off against an opponent from your past, someone you have faced in a previous round. They're stronger than ever, and they're not happy… And they are committed to enacting their vengeance. Monster Mash: Though not strictly necessary, Dracula's Castle does often include a menagerie of spooky creatures waiting in the wings. Fill these out as little or as much as you please. But, because it's the finals of the tenth anniversary, take a look at some of the monsters of ages past for inspiration… After defeating your enemy in their lair, you walk deeper and deeper into the castle. Plunging beneath the earth, you feel yourself leave this plane of existence. In the distance you see a light, a single room… and the sounds of mighty beasts. STAGE 4: LIVING ROOM The way forward is guarded not by any titans or lords of the undead this time. Instead, a panel of judges watches intently, waiting to be impressed. If you wanna get through, you're gonna need to be the best in show. And to do that, you'll have to adopt a cat or a dog to defeat your opponent's cat or dog in a contest! Here are the wonderful animals just waiting to be adopted! CATS | DOGS -----|-------- Xiaohei |Den Catra | Legosi Old Hob |Infinite Nepeta Leijon | Doggie Krueger Puss in Boots | Chewbacca What The Dog Doin? That's right, it's Nintendogs/Cats time. Your team must prepare one of these furry critters to fight against your opponent's furry critters in a dog/cat competition. Get Outta Here! Go On! As attached as you have become to you have certainly become to your furry friend, they cannot stay forever. Because… After all the trials and tribulations, only one team member remains. Reality falls apart around them as they hurtle through space, witnessing the collapse of stars, the birth of cosmos. They have reached… FINAL DESTINATION It all comes down to this. One final battle. For the sake of the world. And more importantly. To become champion. No Items. Fox Only. Final Destination. By this point, each of your teams are down to their last member. Write a 1v1 to end the set and claim your crown. Whether your team selects a champion, or the rest have fallen, it comes down to this final match. Omega Form: You can tackle the previous stages in any orde you want. You can even merge them together if you want. But Final Destination is the Final Destination. No gimmicks here. Just a brawl till the very end. --- FINAL ROUND VS FIGHT",The following is a work in progress and is not yet finalized. Will edit the post later with the full story. Apologies for the delay! Health problems have made progress slow.

They have taken over the ministry of magic and are going to go through with their plans against muggles. Can we win? Honestly what is protego going to do against a tank round to the head?

Also there are not that many hardcore followers of Voldemort, most are just scared and would fight against him if given the chance.","Nah, not a chance.

Throughout the date, Ross extensively shares information including: his marriages to and divorces from Carol, Emily and Rachel, his children with Carol and Rachel, being Monica's first kiss, dating one of his own college students, and the events leading up to/during/after his breakup with Rachel putting much emphasis on the 'on a break' debate. He will also ask them whether they would rather drown or be burned alive, and accidentally call them 'Rachel' on various occasions. Other events during the date will include: Ross discovering someone has thrown out his sandwich at work and reacting similarly as in ""The One With Ross's Sandwich"", getting his leather pants stuck off similar to ""The One With All the Resolutions"".",He also needs to share about the time he tried to make out with his cousin and then stayed silent for a really really long time before telling her it's been a long time since he's had sex.
"argumenta sobre: The floor is lava. Can humanity survive? A game for kids that went too far. The surface of the solid earth is now covered by 5 cm of lava.

Vehicles get lava as a building if their surface is larger then 2 hectars humanity doesn't know the exact measure, but know that big boats get lava and small ones don't. Glaciers get lava, unless below the ice there's only water. The lava is regular basaltic lava, at a temperature of 950 °C 1,740 °F and will cool off as usual. Can humanity survive?

argumenta sobre: The Avengers MCU all mysteriously disappear before the first film and Fury has to scramble enough replacements to replace them can this back up team defeat Loki? While Nick Fury is creating the Avengers initiative all of his candidates vanish off the face of the earth and now he needs to find some replacements and fast! and let's say to make the prompt interesting Nick drops Captain Marvel's pager and broke it so she can't show up and solo the fight. Can this last second team still save New York and defeat Loki? If they do how does the team continue if it does at all? Ghost At this point she was still a secret agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. and is recruited in exchange for a cure for her condition War Machine Mark ll He's no Ironman but you find a better guy in a robot suit at short notice The Red Guardian Risking an international incident S.H.I.E.L.D. breaks Alexi out of prison with promises of diplomatic immunity and acceptance back at his motherland The Winter Soldier Since the end of the world is bad for business the shadier HYDRA-ier parts of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulls some strings to wake up an old soldier to fight again The Abomination Nick promised Blonsky some time off his sentence if he did some... community service A squadron of Hammer drones This is how you can tell Nick is really desperate,"Okay this is going to get weird. I'mma break down the characters real quick, and then see how they deal with the final battle since Loki probably skips from Germany to New York with no Avengers to fight. Our New Dark Avengers: Ghost. Cool powers like Intangibility and Invisiblity along with enhanced Strength. Really good skill set and powers along with ablility to sneak into Stark Tower and shut down the Laser and maybe even fight Loki. A better Black Widow War Machine might be better than Iron Man in this scenario. Nothing Tony's suit can do that Rhodey's can't do just as well if not better since Tony's not just going to leave his buddy in the dust. Rhodey trades those cool red lasers for fire power. Just a note, at this point in the timeline Rhodey would be using an unrebranded Iron Patriot so that's what Imma be using so it's sleeker, not too bulky so it's speedy and has no issue with the icing problem. He might do everything Tony did but better. Red Guardian. Basically a shitty Steve Rogers. Good fighter and strong as fuck but he's got nowhere near the leadership skills or self sacraficing nature of Steve. He might actually hurt the team in one respect. Winder Soldier. Good at killing and not much else. Bucky isn't really Bucky right now and no one is going to recongize him past Red Guardian and Alexei is not fucking liking him if he finds out about what he did to Natasha one time or if they met in the old days. He and Alexei could blow the team up if they don't have their heads on straight whether Alexei uses the chaos to kill Buck or if Buck thinks Alexei might do that so he kills him to make the mission easier. Abomination is a better team mate but a worse combatant. Abomination seems to be okay with reforming as Shang Chi showed us and it's been 4 years since Harlem so he might be pretty chill. Overall the only defect with him seems to be that Hulk was super fucking eager to wreck shit during Avengers 1 which might hurt Bolonski's chances but he can and will be directed better so it's a coin toss. Hammer Drones are okay to be used. I honestly don't see a single one of them surviving. Justin Hammer didn't really even design them and his involvment might not be the best descision for anyone and Tony and Rhodey beat the shit out of them in scores. But let's talk about benefits, mostly that Justin if involved will follow all of Nick's shit to the letter. He is going to be super scared of Nick offering up only offering up a passive resistance. So now group dynamics: OG Avengers had a good dynamic after blowing up fast. Cap was unequivically the leader with a great tactical mind, Thor and Hulk were powerhouses capable of mass destruction, Iron Man was a great utility and gadget player with good moblity, Hawkeye was their eye in the sky and Black Widow was deadly as hell along with the most mission focused playing a instrumental role in ending the conflict. Now here's the group dynamics come in. They kinda worked well together. Clint and Natasha were already friends, Tony isn't so much of an ass that he couldn't work with anyone and is able to pull of being a snarky prick so it doesn't so much interupt team stuff along with already working with Widow and ending up with an okay relationship as time went on, Cap is Cap and did the right thing letting Hulk be Hulk who also saved Tony I think because Tony was nice to Bruce and wanted him and Hulk to become Professor Hulk. Thor was also super able to pal around with everyone. Now our Dark Avengers are uh not that. While the Avengers might be described as a ticking time bomb, this team might implode mid mission. I already mentioned Winter Soldier and Alexei's shit but let's break it down further. No one is friends with anyone on this team. We've got: Career military dude Rhodey who knows how shit supposed to work and defacto leader who is not going to get along with Justin Hammer at all or Red Guardian. Might get along well with Ghost and Abomination though. Rhodey though is a great leader but the challenge here might be too big. Will do his best and might pull it off. Justin Hammer is not the biggest detriment to the team suprisingly. He's not going to be liked and Rhodey and he might have tension, but Rhodey isn't going to blow the mission cause of him and Nick can easily keep him in check. Honestly Alexei might like the dude just to mess with him as ""little buddy"". Ghost is probably an okay team mate. She's not evil in anyway and just wants a cure which is going to drive her. She, Rhodey and Abomination might get along real well. Abomination is going to be okay with anyone on this team. He rehabed pretty well assuming he's been doing this before Wong and won't do anything to really upset team dynamics. Winter Soldier is not going to really do anyone wrong. He's there to kill and that's about it. He'll creep people out sure but he's not going to mess anything up. Alexei might blow this thing for the whole team. Dude will be absolutely convinced he should be the leader and might undermine Rhodey's chances of leading the team efficiently. He will absolutely not get on with Winter Soldier at all and might try to fight him there and then. Okay so fight: Rhodey is pulling triple duty here since with no Thor or Cap, he's taking on leadership duty, and trying to fight the most and biggest people since he's the big gun. Ghost and Winter Soldier are probably doing Black Widow and Hawkeye stuff but I think both of them realize pretty quick their talents are better served trying to close the portal rather than limit civilian casualties. Ghost might actually do the most civilian saving here since she's not a bad guy and will listen to Rhodey but Buck's b lining for Stark Tower. The Hammer Drones take over for Tony suprisingly well. They issue is that they have the same issues as the Chitari. They can't bank worth a damn and I don't think the expert piloting of Justin or even SHEILD agents could make up for it as opposed so as the fight goes on their effectiveness at keeping that perimeter is going to go down. Abomination does what the Hulk does and maybe saves a few civillians in there as well but he might not take out as many Leviathans or Chitari as Hulk. Alexei can maybe keep up with Cap but after giving the Cops their instructions might go after Loki too. So Loki first faces off against rather than Thor or Hulk, Winter Soldier and Alexei. And he does really well against them. Loki fought Thor in a losing effort twice and threw the fight against Cap in Avengers 1 so he's a stronger but weaker than Thor against 2 Cap ish level dudes. They don't pressure him enough to leave the Tower like in Avengers 1 but what they do do is buy enough time for Ghost to get there. Ghost finds Selvig and he tells her about the Staff. She tells Rhodey and everyone B-lines for Loki especially since at around this point, the Hammer Drones are probably all dead. Loki loses to everyone here and Ghost gets the staff. Coucil launches Nuke, Rhodey intercepts and launches it through the portal. Alexei and Winter Soldier take each other on. So yeah, they can win but only if a Loki doesn't kill Alexei or Buck bThey hold him off long enough for Ghost to get there. c Alexei and Buck don't kill each other. &x200B; Also Rhodey is going to have to put in a super human effort here to put all this together and their is going to be so much more civillian casuallties."
"argumenta sobre: All dead US presidents come back to live to run for the election My first post here. I know the current American election system might be a mess when there are over 40 candidates, so let's just assume the one who gets the most votes wins. All of them have all the info and knowledge they need about the modern world and politics. Both parties stay neutral, and every living politician or celebrity can support whoever they wanna support. All the candidates would have zero campaign finance at the beginning and have to raise funds for themselves. They can also quit if they don't think there's much chance of winning. All the living presidents Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump, and Biden won't participate. Edit: I forgot that Carter's also alive.","Real talk, what do you even say in a debate against Lincoln?

argumenta sobre: How far would Spider Man realistically make it in our world Was inspired by a question that asks this but with Superman. How long would Peter last if he was in the real world? Peter in this scenario has the exact same origin and was born in New York and decides to be a hero. What would be the realistic reactions and thoughts to him and how far does he last in our world?,"If he decides to be a comic book hero, I don't think there's anyway the government can ignore him and with the amount of surveillance in nyc, he'd probably get caught pretty fast. He would absolutely dominate in any sport he chose though. And he could use all the sport contract money to do a lot of good. That'd probably be the best way for him to be a ""hero."""

"argumenta sobre: How much of a speed and strength increase would it take to make melee combat viable in modern day warfare? Not overpowering, just a viable option. Make it like a 50/50 when it comes to ranged and melee combat. I was inspired for this one based off of Wonder-Woman 2017. What kind of boost would be required for melee divisions to be added to warfare?","Speed is the bigger factor. You'd have to be at least faster than a person can see, to be reliably faster than a person can aim. However fast one has to get a speed blur or afterimage effect, I suppose. A bigger improvement would be durability, or force field like armour. Like the personal shields in Dune, without the potential explosion risk with lasers.

argumenta sobre: Johnny Test's sisters vs Jimmy Neutron vs Dexter laboratory vs Stewie Griffin Who wins in a battle to the death. Only one survivor Edit: over 1 thousand up votes?? Never expected this.,Everyone is saying Stewie but assuming everyone is equally bloodlusted I reckon the Test twins win it.

"argumenta sobre: An average man gets stuck inside an infinite time loop and the only way out is to beat prime Michael Jordan at a 1v1 basketball match. How long does it take until he gets out? The average man starts off with recreational basketball playing ability and is given 23 hours of prep time everyday before his matchup against Michael Jordan. The man is given unlimited funds to train for this matchup. Each time he loses, the time loop resets back to the start of the day. Michael Jordan is not aware of the time loop and will not remember any of the previous games played within the time loop. The man will retain his memories, as well as any changes to his basketball playing ability, athletic ability, and changes to his body. The man will not age, die, or go insane, but he is susceptible to injury. The game is first to 21 points, under typical 1-on-1 basketball rules.","If it's make it take it, the average man wins via a bunch of circus shots in a row sometime within a century If it's alternating possessions, he only wins if MJ has a stroke or something"

Geralt will try his best to kill Cap, and Cap will try his best to survive and defeat Geralt, or kill him if he has to.","Game Geralt has access to a lot of shit.

Let's say this Space Marine is from the Blood Angels and is teleported to the Overwatch universe. Who's the strongest hero from Overwatch that the Space Marine can kill?,"I think the only people that a Space Marine can't beat would be Winston and Doomfist with a very huge maybe on the latter one as we just know he has bulletproof skin, but we don't know how he interacts with say sharp, penetrative objects. Maybe Genji too but that seems more rocket tag and less ""can't beat that 1v1"".

Who is the strongest character that cannot touch their toes? I'm thinking the Blob Marvel Comics. In most iterations it doesn't look like he can touch his toes. Rules: 1 Must normally have toes to touch. E.g., Cthulhu, Arceus, and Jabba the Hutt, all of which do not usually have toes, cannot be included no matter how powerful they are. 2 We are considering them in their strongest form. E.g., whether Piotr can touch his toes isn't relevant, it's whether Colossus can touch his toes. 3 Mech suits, piloted robots, other cop-out answers, etc. don't count as characters.","I don't know who else, but there is Po from Kung Fu Panda, and I think he could beat the Blob?"

"argumenta sobre: ""Zombie"" apocalypse but it's dogs and cats Instead of ppl turning into dumbass corpses, infected ppl turn into dogs and cats all different types, including animals like wolves and lions. The dogs and cats will not turn on each other like actual zombies. Dogs and cats will act like their animal self other than mindlessly pursuing humans. If a dog infects, victim turns into a canine and if a cat infects, they turn into a cat. Infection is via bite, scratch or excessive licking. Current dogs and cats will spread transmission and are now ""zombies"" but tbf, they won't spread transmission until 72 hours after initial attacks. Patients zero is a cute puppy in NYC in Central Park at peak times and another in Beijing as a stray cat during peak times. Ppl turn within 10 mins from bites or scratches, but excessive licking can take 24 hours provided the dog/cat saliva does enter the body and just stays on the skin. Does humanity survive? Bonus: humans that turn into cats and dogs still have their human brain/mindset. They can choose to side with humans by not ""infecting"" others. They can also now speak their native language. All current/wild dogs and cats will still be animals and try and turn humans. Edit: the cats and dogs are NOT zombies. They're normal cats and dogs. They act like their normal animal self. That's why licking is a way of transmission because a dog or cat can be affectionate that way",Cat's are min-maxed predators. They're literally the perfect animal to do this.

"argumenta sobre: What characters could absolutely humiliate Hannibal Lectre using only their intellect? And how? I was rewatching Hannibal and at the beginning of season 3, he makes this snide little comment about how what he does isn't cannibalism because he and the rest of humanity are not equals. As in he's so much smarter and better than everyone that they are beneath him. So it got me curious. Who in fiction, without necessarily using superpowers, could run circles around Hannibal? At the end of season 2 they make this big deal about ""if you think you're in control it's only because Hannibal wants you to think that"" Well who could actually be in control but make Hannibal think that he was? Who could manipulate and plan in such a way that by the time Hannibal realizes the truth, he'd be forced to admit he was an idiot compared to them? The Sherlock types are great detectives but I don't see them as master manipulators or strategists. So who? And perhaps as importantly how? A few quick rules: no mind control or other such super powers. And no direct physical confrontation until Hannibal is already mentally beaten down and broken by whatever genius thing they did to dunk on him.","There are a few Batman villains that would be good at this. Namely: Hugo Strange. As a psychologist he wouldn't be phased by Hannibal's tactics of manipulation and as a super genius himself who likes to experiment on people I imagine that he would have a lot of fun in deconstructing Hannibal in Arkham. It might take a few years, but in the end Hugo would recreate Hannibal into something more to his liking. Probably something a lot worse. The Riddler. The Riddler is absurdly smart. Too smart even for his own good as he is very insecure about himself. The idea that Hannibal would consider himself more intelligent would probably drive Edward crazy and to prove himself superior, I imagine he would construct an insane death trap based on a logic puzzle so intricate that Hannibal couldn't possibly escape. The Joker. The Joker would prove he's more intelligent by breaking Hannibal's mind during regular therapy sessions. Hannibal would probably agree to therapy sessions with the Joker too because he'd be trying to do the same thing back. Unfortunately for Hannibal though, I can't see him ever besting the Joker in a battle of wills."

"argumenta sobre: Could 12 Secret Service agents protect a blow-up sex doll from 6 Navy Seals in a crowded mall? Donald Trump has hired his own private security and the Secret Service gets bored and decides to practice for the next president. They must safely transport a blow-up sex doll through the mall for one hour. However, 6 Navy Seals are dead set on deflating this sex doll. Rules are as follows: - Secret Service gets one week to scout the mall - Secret Service gets access to all their usual intelligence and equipment - Sex Doll must be carried around at normal walking speed, except in combat and stopping for normal browsing in the mall can't hide in a bathroom stall for the whole hour - Navy Seals have access to all their normal equipment, but no outside intelligence - Navy Seals get one hour to recon the mall and set up before the sex doll arrives they don't know which entrance the sex doll will be using - Navy Seals win if they deflate or gain control of the sex doll edit: didn't specify, but should have: SEALs hurting any civilian means they lose.",Even if the Secret Service gets a week prep and all their resources I think the SEALs just bring too much firepower. Most agents are only armed with a P229. The SEALs also have the advantage of being able to initiate an amush at their own will.
"argumenta sobre: 1 German Maus Tank WWII super-heavy tank vs 100 Sherman tanks US WWII medium tank. The Maus has an elite German tank crew, tank aces. The Sherman's have average combat tested crews. They have been in combat several times before and are well trained, but not considered ""elite"". Terrain is flat and lightly wooded. Just the tanks are fighting, no other combat units or air support around. Both the maus and the Sherman's have a mix of AP shells and HE shells. Maus is loaded to the brim with extra shells. Maus could hold 68 shells for the main gun and 100 for the secondary 75mm gun, but I imagine it could hold more if the crews tried to stuff it. Who wins?","Sherman easily. 1. It's tracks aren't any stronger other tank, could be disabled by normal weapons. 2. It still only has one turret but two cannons, so it can only target one tank at a time. It would maybe knock out a few Sherman but then gets disabled by returning fire. Sherman would shoot the tracks to immobilize it first, then aim for turret ring to jam it. Sherman could hit it with concentrated white phosphate shell until Maus was either set on fire or crews all died from inhalation burns. Tank back then didn't have overpressure NBC system."

Perhaps a few dozen Homelanders could make a difference. Especially if we're talking about Void, there is no character or group in The Boys universe capable of defeating the Void. Even Sentry alone can effortlessly destroy most settings you're familiar with. Simply put, he is overwhelmingly powerful. Homelander is the strongest in his own universe, but he's not a character who could challenge Sentry or make a difference in the Marvel universe.

Biological processes that require zinc are modified to no longer require it, but other than that, humanity must make do on its own. Can we survive? How much damage does this change do? R1. No warning. R2. Humanity gets a year of warning.","I think humanity would survive. For a start, there are small tribes living in the middle of nowhere without any metal. But, more generally, not that many critical things use zinc. Zinc is often used in corrosion protection. So even in round 1, humanity has some time before problems appear. Ships and bridges start rusting faster without their sacrificial zinc, but they don't rust overnight. Some electronics probably breaks. Especially with the old and less used zinc batteries. Brass becomes pure copper, and is somewhat weaker but doesn't break down instantly. White zinc oxide paint turns into black copper oxide. A few industrial processes probably explode.

"argumenta sobre: Who is the weakest character that could beat Rand al'Thor in a head-to-head fight? They start 100 feet apart from one another in a grassy valley. Rand is unaided at his peak channeling ability before fighting the Dark One. Mountain level feats, can level or delete cities. He is alert, no waiting for him to fall asleep to just stab him. Balefire works, and Rand won't refrain from using it. Ta'veren works insofar as someone would feel compelled to bend to Rand's will, but no plot armor. Bonus round: Epilogue Rand, but I'm not sure it's even possible to beat him then.","I'm not sure who it would be, but the categories of that person would have to be someone with psychic abilities, reality warper or speedster. I can't remember if he had a angreal or sa'angreal at the battle at Algarin's Manor. But he was weaving hundreds of weaves at once. Post veins of gold it is heavily implied that the Light itself is what merged his memories and kept his Madness from getting worse, so a psychic attack might or might not work. Balefire is lightspeed, but draining enough that he can't spam it. So a sufficiently fast character might be able to dodge it and get in close for a kill. Reality warper would have to be sufficiently strong enough to counteract his Ta'veren property. Ta'veren is plot armor though, just codified as an in universe property. Reality warps in his favor, but he doesn't directly control it. As for post Last Battle its hard to say. We see him use one ability on an extremely small scale with no explanation or how or why it works. He's definitely a reality warper at this point, but we have no idea on what scale. And ibdont think he would want to explore it much. He'll use it to make life easier, but I do not think he'll ever use it offensively. His character arc is done, he doesn't want to be anyone special ever again. He goes full circle to being a simple shepherd again."

Also there is no reason to believe most of his stuff would have any effect on characters like Hulk and Thor.

No possibility of using any modern weapons, and no possibility to fix or manufacture them. Cars, ships and planes are possible to use for transport, but any intention of using them to kill someone would cause them to malfunction and stop working. It's a melee game, and the world is at an all out war. Who dominates who?","Dominating the world would become several orders of magnitude more difficult, and likely nobody would. In this scenario, defense just got much easier and offense much harder. You can still develop regional dominance if you can get places with melee weapons. Since the prompt eliminates aircraft and ships that are weapons, I'd assume it doesn't disallow transport air and ships. If it does the entire nature of the question changes and nations that depend heavily on importing food and fuel - China being the biggest example - are screwed. If the prompt doesn't allow you to transport infantry forces on unarmed ships, then my suggestions below are changed. While these circumstances tilt the field towards regional powers, few of the high population countries can exploit it. China is fairly hemmed I. By geography. If it decides to conquer it can get to some places, but its bigger rivals - Taiwan and Japan - just got stronger because now it lacks capacity to project power to them. It can put lots of soldiers on transport vessels, sure. That's vastly less effective than being able to fire missiles and weapons, but But those vessels are more vulnerable than ever. Defensive technology like mines that do not move on their own seem like they'd still work. And when they get to the beaches, defense infrastructure is even better. America likely is the biggest loser, though. America is the world's strongest military but it's actually mostly a naval power. That asset just vanished. It can no longer rain hell with a carrier group or interdict trade routes at will. America remains mostly impregnable due to geography, but its ability to protect power is gone. It would develop a lethal infantry force that can defeat anything generated in the western hemisphere. But it would face the same challenges China does in projecting that power. While those two superpowers are losing in this world, others gain. If you have access to resources over land, a good geography, a decent population and the ability to move against enemies overland, you'll gain. Russia has a decent population but is in the early stages of demographic collapse. It can defeat Ukraine in a melee war, but the cost will be higher than ever and cripple it long term. Its ambition may end right there. Poland, however is currently in a better spot than ever to defend itself and maybe even project a little power. It's relatively young. It has the problem of access, though: its geography is not that defensible. Turkey would be in a great spot. It has proven a warrior culture and has an enviable geography. It would rise in power in this world. France has something of a defensible position and a strong population. Germany, like Russia, lacks the people to be anything more than a regional power. If you're an island nation, you're vastly more defensible, but island nations have always relied on using naval power to get what they want. That's mostly gone. Japan, UK, Australia and even the United States are net losers to some degree. Sure nations like the Americans and Brits would absolutely develop crack Marine forces, which seem possible by the rules of the prompt, but that is so much harder and more expensive than pounding an enemy through the air. May not even be worth the costs. Geography matters more than it ever has. Anyone with overland access to its rivals is also accessible by its rivals. Israel would be in trouble but will adapt to highly refined defensive strategies and high quality infantry. Nobody on its borders is getting to it easily. By the rules of the prompt, explosives are still working, you just can't fling them through the air or otherwise project them. So nukes likely still function if you truck them somewhere and detonate them. Countries with those weapons would be able to nuke other countries but they can't fire them directly. They have to get them to their enemies. In all, everyone got more defensible, America is going to withdraw from the eastern hemisphere but increase its reliance on the western hemisphere. Europe sort of becomes old school Europe with many countries bordering on each other all of whom can attack each other. The Middle East probably has the most defensible geography. It will be able to expel any foreign force it wants to, but also cannot particularly expand. I know countries always were able to project power pre-industrial with largely infantry based melee forces. But these are vastly differing circumstances. Those forces did have ranged weapons. Those forces fought in times where explosive devices didn't exist. No mines. Castles took decades to build. We can build defenses much faster now with modern construction materials and equipment. Defense is vastly stronger and offensive capabilities hugely clipped. Overall this likely creates a more peaceful world because the cost of conquest is so high."
"argumenta sobre: Who is the weakest Marvel Mutant that could attain the 1 Hero spot in MHA? MHA/616 Marvel's mutants run the gamut of powers, from being weaker than normal humans X-Ceptional to being strong enough to destroy the universe Franklin Richards Pretty wide scale for something caused by a single gene... but whatever. Where on the scale of Beak to Legion would a mutant have to be in order to attain the 1 Hero spot in MHA's Japan? For the sake of the prompt assume that the mutant in question will understand Japanese and understand how the world works. Mutations and quirks are functionally identical, so stuff like Eraserhead works on the mutant. The mutant wants to be the 1 Hero, even if the mutant would normally be completely uninterested in such things. Personality remains, so those without charisma would still have no charisma, but they'd be trying to be a hero.","It's always going to be Kitty Pryde. In every single prompt about the weakest marvel character that can do X. You even narrowed it down to mutants.

So, what happens if he fights someone who is obviously stronger than any human that has ever lived? Maelys Blackfyre can kill a war horse with a punch, tear off a man's head with his hands, and is half a foot taller than Aragorn's 6'6''. He also wields the Valyrian steel sword Blackfyre. Can he win? Proof for Maelys' feats: ""He won the command of the Golden Company by fighting his cousin, Daemon Blackfyre, for it, killing his cousin's destrier with a single punch and then twisting Daemon's head until it was torn from his shoulders."" World of Ice and Fire.","Aragorn has around 7-8 decades of fighting experience if we go by LotR timeline, but potentially two centuries and would be considered one of the best warriors of his era. And this is an era filled with plenty of tremendous warriors that would easily rival any of the feats of any character from Westeros. He excels not only in physical prowess, but in all the qualities of mankind. He represents a return to the greatest examples of his people. He is a living legend in a land of legends. There is no scenario in which Maelys overcomes Aragorn. A Uruk-Hai is a more formidable match than Maelys is and they are mowed down by Aragorn."

"argumenta sobre: Hand to hand combat - could anybody, present or past, beat a UFC Champion? I saw a Reddit post today asking if an ancient Spartan warrior could beat a modern-day UFC champion like Jon Jones and almost unanimously people said no. Got me thinking, is there anybody either currently or previously alive at any point inside or outside the MMA world that you believe could hold their own or beat a UFC champion with all the best modern training, nutrition etc in pure hand to hand combat? Here's the conditions: - Open arena the size of the Colosseum. - ""Beat"" I'm gonna say fight to the death or until the other person simply cannot fight any longer. No holds-barred, no DQ, no ref, nobody stepping in. - No weapons, no gloves, no other body protection. Just trunks and hand-to-hand combat, any type of striking, dirty tactics allowed as mentioned. - Would have to be in the same weight class or it just gets silly. - Can also include a general ""best of"" in your proposal for the other fighter. Example, Khabib vs ""the best Roman gladiator from this time period"" or ""the best Templar knight from the crusades"" just examples. - No mythical figures like Hercules etc. So there we go, the very best UFC fighters from the last 10 years, fully fit and ready to fight. Can anybody from any point in time beat them and if so, who?","same weight, no armor, no weapons? beating a modern UFC champion is a hard ask. The human body can only move efficiently in a few ways. There isn't some long forgotten secret that people in the past knew we don't know today. people get knocked out when hit, pass out when choked, and roll around in pain when limbs are broken. Fighting mechanics have always been the same. A jab and right hand is the most efficient way of throwing a punch from point A to point B. So no, based on boxing alone, there aren't any people that would punch better than modern-day boxers. Therefore, the same applies to mma. only exception would be a freak genetic knight heavyweight who would somehow overpower John Jones, but the chances are minimal."
"argumenta sobre: Who is the strongest character that a Prime Human Male could defeat? Our Prime Human Male we will call him Matt is a fully developed human of 6 foot 3 and 93kg, with a Perfect 10 face Golden Ratio Proportion of 1.618 and has the combined talents, skills, and abilities of all humans on the planet, whether physical, social, or intellectual. To simplify matters, Matt has the same skill level as the best human in each field. To explain things: Matt has the same physical skills and abilities as the maximum skill level shown by any individual human. The maximum sprint speed, acceleration, stamina, agility, balance, flexibility, strength, etc. that any human has shown. He can run for 350 miles at a time without stopping and can do this at a fast speed. This man has mastered all gymnastic, acrobatic and athletic abilities to the same level that in existence has. Matt has maxed out durability of all muscles, bones, and organs as any human does. He has the strongest immune system known to man, and has immunity to countless diseases, including COVID, HIV, and measles. He can consume exceptionally large quantities of alcohol before feeling even slightly drunk. He can recover from any injuries and illness as fast as humans can currently. He has high sleep deprivation immunity, and only needs 4 hours of sleep a night to feel refreshed. He has low oxygen resistance and can climb Everest without using an oxygen mask. He also has resistances to poison he can endure hundreds of snake and scorpion venoms, freezing he can swim for at least a km in freezing water and can stay submerged in ice for 2 hours, heat he is unaffected by boiling cooking oil and can briefly function normally whilst on fire and electricity he can withstand an electrical current at least 10 times stronger than the current required to kill the average human. He can eat a punch or kick and can take a bullet or blade stab as well as anyone. He also has unbreakable bones. Matt has the same mastery of all objects as the best humans. He is as good with any weapon as anyone else e.g., as good with a sniper as the best sniper, as good with throwing knives with the human with the best throwing knife ability. Also, he is equally the best aircraft pilot, water vessel and road vehicle drive alongside the best humans. And our man is also the most skilled when it comes to music, sports, acting, filmography, arts etc. Our man is ambidextrous, so can use either hand with equal ability for any task. Matt has the combined knowledge of every single human currently in existence. Our man knows everything that any one person knows. He can fluently speak all spoken languages, and knows as much about all subjects of both theory and real-world case study in fields such as mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, economics, philosophy, political science, history, geography, linguistics, etc. He can fulfil the role of any profession with the same level of skill as the best of those professions, as if he has had the same level of training. He the same tactical understanding of all sports as any athlete both as a spectator and when actively participating. He is a master of all known board game moves. ·Matt has the same IQ and cognitive abilities as the highest shown by any currently living human, and has a maxed out sensory system, being able to smell any scent, taste any flavour, and hear any sound, that can be heard. He has tetrachromacy due to the existence of a fourth colour cone and can see additional colours. He also has an eidetic and photographic memory. As well as being a human cyclopaedia, Matt is also a human calculator, and can carry out large calculations almost instantly. He is a music prodigy and can perform a full musical score pitch perfectly after hearing a sound or piece of music just the once. He can also recreate a human face through any artform by only seeing them once. He is a master of all known board game moves. Mentally, Matt has positive mental skills maximised in accordance with humans. He has as much confidence, bravery, courage, willpower, determination etc. as the best humans. He also has the same charisma as the most charismatic humans and has maximum oratory skills of all kinds. He is aware of, and a master of all sociological and physiological techniques known and used by mankind. However, despite having the most confidence of anyone, Matt is never overconfident or arrogant, and knows his limits, being a humble king. Basically, any favourable personality attribute, our man has. Basically, what ever any human currently knows, Matt knows. Whatever they can do, he can do. So, my question is, who is the most powerful character which Matt can defeat? Round 1 – Matt has the combined current skillsets/abilities of all humans currently for example, the human will be able to run 100m at least as fast as the sprinter who wins Gold at the Olympics in Paris – however, this sprinter may not have the fastest acceleration possible or may not be able to reach the fastest sprint speed possible. Round 2 – Round 1 but all humans are now in their current/past prime for example, he will be able to run a hour marathon like prime Eliud Kipchoge – however, if he has greater stamina, acceleration etc. than Kipchoge, he might be able to run at a much faster pace for 26 miles, therefore it may be possible for Prime Man to run a marathon in well under 2 hours. Round 3 – Round 2 but extended to all humans who have ever lived. Round 4 – Round 3 but extended to all fictional humans but without any superhuman abilities. Superheroes can exist in their human alter-ego form. For example, Peter Parker and all is human abilities, including his intelligence, can be included, but not Spiderman's superhuman abilities. Also, Matt will not be given the abilities of any superhuman equipment or suits – he will not start off with an Iron Man suit, for example, but he is allowed to create one in this round or in any earlier round, if he has the means. Round 5 – Round 4, but Matt also has the combined absolute skillset and abilities of all living animals. Matt is still 6foot3 and 93kg, but can lift 6000kg like the African Elephant, has a top running speed of 75mph like the Cheetah, has a vertical of 18 feet like a puma, has the bite force 3700 pounds and skin durability of the Saltwater Crocodile. Matt can leap for a distance of 45 feet and land at any target with accuracy whilst reaching max vertical height mid-jump. Matt has the ability to fly – and can do so at a horizontal speed of 100mph like the Mexican Free-Tailed Bat, or at 242mph whilst in a diving motion like the Peregrine Falcon. Matt can operate equally well under water and can swim at speeds of up to 82mph like the Black Marlin, while he can also breathe underwater In terms of vision, Matt has the long-distance vision of the Eagle, and is able to spot and focus upon individuals and objects from up to 2 miles away and has the night vision of an Owl; Matt can even see magnetic fields, like the European Robin. Matt can hear sound frequencies of up to 300kHz like the Moth. Matt has the refined sense of smell of a Bloodhound and can follow a sent trail for 130miles. Matt possesses all animal communication techniques. You get the idea. However Matt does not have any maximised abilities relative to body size e.g., strength-to-body-size ratio Round 6 – Round 6, but also including all animals which have ever lived, including dinosaurs, and now has maxed out strength-to-body-size and other similar ratios e.g., vertical jump. For example, Dung Beetles can lift 1141 times their body weight, so Matt can now carry just over 100000kg. Fleas can jump 220 times their body length and 150 times their body height, so Matt can now just under 420m in length and 285m in height. The Californian Mite has a speed of 322 body lengths per second, and Matt's equivalent speed would be approximately 1300mph. Matt, who approximately has 21 times the body length of the Mexican Free-Tailed Bat, so should be able to cover over 2100mph whilst flying. You get the idea. For each round, you are allowed to consider both A No prep time and B Unlimited prep time. So what characters and animals can Matt defeat in each round?",Matt is nice. I like Matt. I'm adopting Matt as my bro dammit.

"argumenta sobre: Master Chief Halo replaces Titus Warhammer 40k and has to go through the events of Warhammer 40k Space Marine 1 Master Chief has standard gea/you know what I mean. He replaces Titus at the intro cutscene He gets the intro ""space logs"" beamed into his helmet interface so he knows where he is Graia why he is there to secure the titans after a xeno invasion hits Graia etc. For all intents and purposes everyone that isnt Master Chief will see/touch/hea/smell/blablabla Titus when they see/touch/blablabla Master Chief even if it makes no sense for example Titus is bigger than Chief so how would they feel the same to touch? assume there is an imperceptible ""Titus field"" around Chief that makes up for the physical inconsistencies. R1 no Cortana R2 with Cortana R3 with Cortana and with 1 month preptime before he replaces Titus he has access to the entire Warhammer 40k wiki for that 1 month.","So the first major issue is his loadout, you're right we all know what that means Magnum AR and maybe some frags. Not enough to carry him through the first moments of combat as we see Ork Boyz take multiple Bolter Rounds in the game to kill, an AR is not sufficient. I for the purposes of keeping my sanity and the fun of the prompt will be assuming he has a few selections from the UNSC Arsenal and picks things that would be proper for this mission. Probably things along the lines of the Hydra, Sniper, or Stanchion, a SAW probably is just as good as an AR but the extra mag capacity allows for more focus firing which is going to be key for dealing with some of the other units besides Boyz. The next major issue is going to be his lack of Warp Resistance. Sure while other 40k characters tend to just use immense willpower to resist warp shenanigans, Chief has not encountered it to be experienced in defeating daemons or to utilize his will to deny the witch like Black Templars do. Titus had to grab the power source pretty much unshielded and carry it around while dealing with Bloodletters and Heretic Astartes. I fancy Chief is failing even in R2 due to this. I mean even if he managed to get all the way to the Boss Fight with Nemeroth or however you spell it lol, he now needs to fight a marine in terminator plate, who has some warp powers, and is actively transforming into a Daemon Prince. I don't fancy his chances. In R3 it goes a very different way lol. Cortana scans through the wiki and tells Chief to use Titus' Captain Credentials to requisition Malum Caedo from Boltgun to help the 2nd Company. From there the war is won and Leandros doesn't prove to be a little snitch to the rest of the Chapter depriving them of a Chaplain, this leads to Captain Chiefs' corruption and the destruction of the Ultramarines 2nd Company from within./j I had to rush this as I think I have food poisoning and once I start barfing I will defiantly forget to reply to this thread, apologies, I will probably comeback later to update with more details and back up some of my comments like the AR one.

They now seek to become the dormant species of the planet. Can they do it?,"Take over the world no. Ants have about 20% the bios mass of humans, but I suppose they could close the gap. A 10 year old couldn't invent an atom bomb or a computer. They can still be poisoned by regular pesticides. With a coordinated assault and a wiliness to sacrifice themselves at an individual level they could do a lot of damage. They could eat wires, destroy crops - stuff like that. But with no technology communication would be impossible, so every ant colony would be acting completely independently from all of the rest. Other than giving ants the ability to have evil intent, a 10 year old's intelligence wouldn't really benefit them much. At least not if the goal is to conquer and subdue the human race."

Bruce has been monitoring Homelander and Vought for as long as possible without anyone else noticing. He is still a multi-billionaire with his companies and connections to the military which probably makes Vought think he's on their side. His sole goal is to defeat Homelander.

Once that connection is figured out, the US government will get involved, and it's hard to predict exactly how that will go down. Superman often breaks laws, but popular support might mean he's not ever charged or found guilty. Many people will think he's a god as mentioned elsewhere - and he essentially is. Many people will want to study him. Many people will make the argument that he has a moral onus to humanity to be studied and or provide unlimited power or any other myriad of arguments. Him saving people will almost certainly have constant side effects and backfires, it won't be all roses. People will understandably fear him, people will want to use him as a weapon.

argumenta sobre: John Wick vs. Jason Bourne vs. James Bond My boys with the J's are out and I'm curious who is the best. Each fight is a 1 v 1. Just want to know who would win the most. Round 1 - Hand to Hand Combat in your schools cafeteria Round 2 - Same as Round 1 but bloodlusted with a knife. Round 3 - Each is equipped with a pistol of their choosing. Takes place in a Walmart with opponents on opposite sides of the store. All bloodlusted. Bonus - Each is assigned to assassinate each other. Can they all complete their mission? This is happening at separate times as well So they aren't tracking each other at the same time.,"If we are using Craig's Bond I think his ass would get handed to him by Bourne. First Bond in comparatively bad shape, Skyfall references how he failed his physical testing, but M passed him anyways. Second it is suggested in the fourth Bourne film the one with Jermey Reiner that Jason Bourne has been genetically/chemically enhanced in some way to grant him above average physicals and senses. So if it comes to hand to hand combat no matter how bloodlusted either of the two are I think it would fall in Bourne's favour. In pure hand to hand combat I think Wick loses to Bourne for the same reason that Bond does, Bourne is faster, stronger and by far the best at improvisation. While Wick might beat Bond I think for the two of them it could potentially go in the opposite direction I give it to Bourne. Wick's suit, well it grants him a considerable edge, by being bullet proof when it comes to the Gun Fight. Other than that I don't think his Gun-fu grants him such a massive edge, for we have seen Bourne fight against armed opponents in close contact and win. Well Bourne is most likely to retreat when the odds are not in his favour, that's also why he has survived the length of time he has being hunted by the CIA. I could honestly see Bourne going up against Wick discovering that Wick is a master at Gun-Fu and wearing a bulletproof suit, realizing that he is at a disadvantage, then after temporarily incapacitating Wick disappearing into a crowd and later hunting Wick from a safe distance, with a sniper rifle. As for Bond in this scenario goes down first, A lot of these comments are stating that MI6 / SIS would be able to instantly track down Bourne, I don't think that's the case at all. The CIA perhaps the largest and most well funded intelligence organization has spent over 10 years being throughly and completely embarrassed by by Bourne. He even at once point broke into the office of the senior agent not sure if it was a deputy director or not that was hunting him and called the said agent from said office after leading them on a massive wild goose chase. So no I don't think Bond as cool as he is could honestly hunt down Bourne. As as reserved as Craig's Bond is in comparison to the other bonds, he is still the tuxedo wearing, Aston Martin driving, Martini drinking high profile target, were as Bourne is able to far more able to disappear into a crowd, and hide in plain sight, a skill he demonstrates in every film. Wick as good as a he is at tracking criminals I don't think he holds a candle to the MI6 trained and backed Bond or the sheer and frankly superhuman skills of Bourne possesses when it comes to hunting and tracking people. Short answer I think Bourne wins this."
argumenta sobre: Which is the weakest sci-fi civilization that can defeat a Viltrumite Invincible invasion ? Round 1: ''Human'' sci-fi civilization Round 2: Aliens,"Round 1: The Dune universe would give viltrumites a run for their money. Their shields make them completely invulnerable to Viltrumites, unless they make their fists travel slow enough to get through the shields. But realistically, Viltrumites fight so much faster than Dune humans that there's a good chance they'd never discover this. In terms of weaponry, I'm not sure how strong their lasers are, but they can trigger nuclear level explosions by shooting lasers at their force shields. Combine that with actual nukes, precognition and the weirding way, and I think they'd do surprisingly well. Round 2: Precursors from Halo destroy the Viltrumites, it's not even close. So do Forerunners. The Covenant though would probably struggle. But if they unleashed the Flood... it would be terrifying to see Flood-infected viltrumites."

"argumenta sobre: Death Battle 189: Omni-Man VS Bardock Invincible VS Dragon Ball Z Battle Link >!It's time for the new season of Death Battle, this time fully independent! Been looking forward to this and from all the discussion in the previous thread, I was definitley going in with the impression that this would be a stomp in Bardock's favour.!< >!In terms of Analysis Omni-Man's was pretty much the same gist as his previous battle with Homelander but with some extra stats and calculations, no issues there and very well edited. And Bardock's seemed pretty in line with other Dragon Ball analysis. Was cool learning more about his story since I'm not very well versed in Dragon Ball, and I felt it definitley made him out to be more powerful than Omni-Man, especially when they started acknowledging non-canon feats.!< >!The fight itself was awesome. Sometimes the models looked a little odd but the action, the music, the voice acting and especially everything happening in front of that star at the end was awesome. Really happy they're still able to keep up these high quality animations.!< >!Aaaaand the result. Did not expect the Omni-Man win and I think that's gonna be pretty controversial, especially when a lot of the pros for OM seemed to be based off the super high stat calculations. What do y'all think? Did smart atoms really help OM take that win realistically?!< >!NEXT TIME! Joker from Persona 5 VS Giorno from Jojo's Bizare Adenture! I'm a big fan of P5 and don't know anything about Jojo so that's where my bias lands.

The Sun Disc is example of probably the most divisive type of scaling.

Stark is brilliant and reactive and can think his way out of situations but in terms of knowing your enemy and entrapping them with a plan, I think Holmes is better. We've seen Holmes fight, I don't think Tony with no armor stands too much of a chance.

"argumenta sobre: Tiger VS Human This post is mainly to settle an argument between me and a buddy. Some background information: My buddy is a power lifter, about 6'4, 225 pounds of pure muscle. Can deadlift about 605 pounds, squat about 500, and bench press about 365. He insists that in the scenario of a fully grown tiger charging after him, he could kill it. His technique is to put his arm up, let the tiger bite his forearm then gouge its eyes. He does admit that he would probably lose his arm, but in the end he would win. I insisted that the tiger would easily obliterate him in one swift move but he still strongly believes that he would come out victorious so it's time to settle the argument.","Your friend is severely underestimating the force of the Tiger charging him. Forget the teeth and claws - It'd be basically like being hit by a small car. Good luck stopping that by holding your arm out in front of you. Here's a tiger showing how far that force can carry its weight in the air for reference: And here's a lion on average, smaller than tigers dealing with a charging wildebeest by ducking under its horns probably the exact same way it would duck under or over your friends arm if it was in the way: Big cats are built for speed and strength.

Rules • Link has decided to try snatching Shantae to put her into an Empty Bottle, so he can mock Ganon for now having a genie albeit half-genie at his disposal. • He has to get his hands on her and press her against the bottle. She will become small enough to be forced inside. • Shantae will not try to fight back, only willing to run from him. Only if she has nowhere to run will she fight. • If an hour goes by, Link will give up on capturing Shantae. • In all rounds, Link starts 100 meters from Shantae. • Each version of Link gets all their feats and abilities from their universes. They will start off easy with moderate-level equipment, armor, and dozens of arrows and other projectiles, but will switch to their best loadout if desperate. Shantae gets all her feats, abilities, and standard equipment, except from possible Blaster Master crossover showings.

"argumenta sobre: The US military vs. a self-aware crab the size of Maine So for context: I had a dream that a crab-worshipping cult summoned a crab from beneath the arctic, and it took the entire whole of humanity to generate enough spiritual energy to defeat it. However, if this were to really happen and it was just the US military, could they stop Megalocrab? Rules: Both sides are bloodlusted. The crab begins its assault off the coast of New York City. Round 1: no nukes Round 2: nukes are allowed Round 3: MEGACRABAGGEDON!!! 50 crabs, each the sizes of one of the US states, begin their assault on the world. Could all the people in the world stop them?","Maine is 320 miles across. A crab is about 1/10 as tall as it is wide. The crab is 32 miles high. Its eyes sit comfortably in the mesosphere. The Mariana Trench is 7 miles deep. The crab barely gets its claws wet while crossing oceans. It can walk over Mt. Everest and not even notice. Even if the crab can only cover its body length once a minute, it is still moving at like 19,000 miles per hour. The air pressure alone wipes most of the East Coast. The world is fucked from this thing just existing. Good luck trying to hit it with any sort of munitions as hurricane force winds, tsunamis, earthquakes, and the actual crab cause chaos for hundreds of miles in every direction. Even if you cut everything in half and then cut the speed in half a couple more times, I don't think there's anything anyone can do. Just the mass of rotting meat wherever it dies would probably release enough gases to poison the air for hundreds of miles."

"argumenta sobre: Kevin McCallister Home Alone is now a youngling in the Jedi temple during Revenge of the Sith. Can he beat Anakin? Kevin, protagonist of Home Alone, is now a Jedi Youngling with the appropriate level of training for his age. He is reasonably talented but not some sort of force genius. The moment all the adults in the temple are out of reach, Kevin intuits, via the Force, that Anakin has betrayed them and is coming to kill everyone. Can he set up traps capable of stopping the future Darth Vader? Kevin has been putting together partial, incomplete traps for the past year just for fun, without knowing what it is for and rapidly puts them all into effect when he realizes he needs to stop Anakin. Assume that Kevin is favored by many Jedi and extremely resourceful and was therefore able to obtain anything a Jedi could plausibly give him to use for his traps. Kevin himself cannot flee the temple. He must either kill Anakin or incapacitate him in some lasting fashion. If Anakin's precognitive abilities and danger sense make this a stomp, assume that all of Kevin's traps contain some sort of special material or cloaking field that prevents them from being predicted by the Force, or that Kevin has some sort of unique force ability that makes it impossible to predict traps he set up using the force. Anakin can use his speed or other abilities to try and escape them, but will receive no precognitive warnings about them whatsoever and is unable to search for them using the Force even once he knows they're there. In all rounds, there are no Jedi Masters or adults in the temple even after Anakin enters, of course. Anakin will not receive, and cannot draw on, any outside help whatsoever - he has his standard gear and nothing else.",Kevin got caught in the end didn't he?
"argumenta sobre: Could Naruto use talk-no-jutsu to talk down iconic horror villains? Some of these will most likely be a hard 'no', but I'm curious nonetheless. If a character is absolutely no, then Naruto can pummel them as many times as needed for months on end to make the killer lose the will to continue. Round 1: Jason Voorhees. This is the character that brought me to this idea. Jason is a lot more tragic than other horror villains, and is seen sometimes showing, er, compassion? I don't know if that's the right word. He spares kids IIRC, people who look like his mum, and even let a boxer take his best shots at him. Round 2: Freddy Krueger. Now, this one is absolutely a hard no, but talk-no-jutsu is often used after Naruto beats the antagonist to a bloody pile, so could Naruto continue to beat on Freddy, torment him or bully him, to make Freddy chill out or lose his fear factor? For example, Freddy was weak after being forgotten as seen in Freddy v Jason. Round 3: Micheal Myers. Granted, I don't know much about this character, but he's popular so I factored him in. Round 4: Art the Clown. This one is an even harder no, but similar rules as with Freddy. Could Naruto defeat Art time after time for the clown to eventually say ""fuck this"" and give up?","The other commenters are right in that Naruto's talking skills only really work on people who are open to his arguments, but if you want a proper anti-feat to seal the deal, look at the recent issue of Naruto X TMNT. Naruto fails to talk down Shredder, and I feel like any conversation he'd have with a horror movie slasher would go similarly."

"argumenta sobre: Smallest country that can remain completely self-sufficient for a year? What is the smallest country that's able to sustain the below conditions for a year? If that proves trivial, what is the biggest country that could successfully pull it off? Which country could survive the longest? Rules: ""Smallest"" is by population size. The country must be recognised by at least one other country Sentinel Islands do not count and must be either a sovereign country with an internationally recognised government or a dependency thereof with at least some self-governing capacity. Hong Kong counts in the latter category, Taiwan in the former. The country must be completely sealed off from the outside world for one year. No imports and no exports will cross its borders, and no travellers. It may communicate with other countries but no transfer of any goods or people. The country must start immediately and is given no opportunity to prepare or stockpile beforehand. The year begins at the best possible time in most cases just before harvest. The country may devote more resources, land, and labour to farming if necessary so the fact it currently doesn't grow all its own food is not necessarily a disqualifying factor or to other essential services, as it sees fit; it may also consume reserves of any resources it does have. The country may also modify its system of government, laws etc. to suit its needs. It may take any other steps to meet demand encouraging or enforcing energy conservation, victory gardens, etc.. Countries' self-sufficiency depends on at least the following: food, fuel, medicine, electronics, sources of income, and any other essential imports of any kind. Self-sufficiency means the country may not necessarily function normally, but must function stably. Excess mortality due to starvation etc. cf. North Korean in the 1990s must be negligible. Social unrest must be minimised, and if the government is overthrown the country loses. A country need not be strictly self-sufficient i.e. sustainable; so long as it can keep itself going for a year, it's fine if it consumes resources or technology faster than it can replace it.","So, fun history fact. The rationing done by the UK in World War 2 is well known, but less known is that the British government was fairly certain that they would be completely cut off from imports and wanted to see if they could sustain themselves entirely on their own domestic agriculture. They did several indepth studies by various research groups, and the consistent finding was they could easily sustain the country on a very sparse ration of meat, grains and fats, supported by a large supply of easily grown vegetables, particularly root vegetables, Potatoes, turnips, radishes, etc. These could be grown in massive amounts, enough to give a more then adaquate supply to every person in the UK, but it came with a few downsides. The amount of time needed to eat enough to get all the required calories doubled, as well as a 'remarkable' increase in flatulance and feces. Regardless, they proved repeatedly, in small scale testing, that you can sustain a large population on massive supplies of root vegetables, which are easily grown in such numbers. Things never got bad enough for them to put what they learned into practice, but it gave the UK confidence that it was basically impossible to 'starve them out' if it really came down to it. They could simply fall back on mass production of easily grown vegetables and that would be enough to keep everyone healthy and active."

"argumenta sobre: Jaws 1975 vs. Orca 1977 > ""The Great White Terror vs. The Vengeful Killer Whale — who rules the sea?"" --- The Setup: Location: A wide-open stretch of cold Atlantic coastal waters, near a fishing village. No humans involved, just a straight-up animal brawl. Both are bloodlusted, in their prime, and aware of each other's presence. No traps, no outside interference no Brody, no Nolan. --- 🦈 Jaws aka Bruce – Jaws 1975 Stats: Species: Great White Shark Length: 25 feet est. Weight: 3 tons Known Feats: Sinks boats with ease. Bites through metal cages, barrels, and wooden docks. Survives multiple injuries and high-powered weapons until the finale. Shows intelligence in stalking and ambushing prey. Strengths: Massive bite force and powerful jaws. Apex predator instincts. Incredibly stealthy and fast underwater. Takes a lot of damage before going down. --- 🐋 Orca – Orca 1977 Stats: Species: Killer Whale Length: 35+ feet Weight: 6–8 tons Known Feats: Destroys ships and fuel lines. Hurls humans into the air. Bites off limbs and kills great white sharks. Demonstrates emotion, intelligence, and targeted revenge. Strengths: Larger, heavier, and more durable than a great white. Highly intelligent and strategic — learns from experience. Can leap, tail-slap, and knock enemies out of the water. Thick blubber and strong bones offer natural defense. --- 🧠 Fight Breakdown: This fight isn't just brute force — it's strategy vs. savagery. Jaws is faster in short bursts and more relentless, but Orca is smarter, stronger, and used to fighting large prey and threats. Orca can outmaneuver Jaws, strike from above or below, and use tail attacks and slams. Most real-world encounters show orcas dominate sharks, flipping them upside down or targeting their gills. Even if Jaws gets a bite in, Orca's bulk and intelligence will likely turn the tide. --- 🏆 Verdict: > Orca wins 8/10 times With superior size, intelligence, and marine mammal strength, Orca would likely kill Jaws after a brutal battle — possibly using tactics like stunning blows, grappling, or drowning it via disorientation.

We know it corrupts the souls of those that carry it, but a T 800 doesn't have a soul, it has an objective.

Can Conor still win?","It's a tie. Hear me out: Connor stomps his opponent in under 10 seconds, but is bothered for the rest of his life by inexplicable testicular trauma. Every 10 seconds, it feels like someone is kicking him in the nuts. He goes to the doctors, who are clueless about what could be happening. Eventually, he gives up, having been driven mad by the pain. He uses painkillers which get him addicted and kicked out of the UFC.

That person has to officially wrote at least one book themselves, and can't just be someone who helped in publishing the book. 2. This question is taking only the physicality of the author themselves, so political leaders who happen to be an author of something will not be allowed their military capabilities in here.

Hulk can only go Grey but doesn't get any intelligent boost, he's at his dumbest. Has nanomachines working overtime to temper his rage. Thor - Thor is once again made unworthy and treats it like when he lost it when Nick Fury whispered in his ear.

Captain America - Steve is stripped of his Super Soldier Serum and his sheild also has ""Vibranium Cancer"" meaning it could shatter at any moment.

He is armed with Riptide from the start but has no other supplies. Can his at this stage largely un-trained powers compensate for his lack of experience and age enough for him to win the Games?","Riptide can't harm mortals, only monsters and gods, so that's basically useless. First book Percy is also at his weakest, and a few weeks of training at best. Let's also keep in mind the Gamemakers, who might not notice the waterbending Percy pulls off thanks to the Mist, but will absolutely screw him over to keep things interesting. He also probaby won't get sponsers for at least the first few days since he randomly replaces Katniss the day of the Games. Best case scenario- Percy manages to grab a sword and supplies from the Cornucopia, runs to the nearest body of water, camps there, and the Gamemakers ignore him forever, and he wins the Games. Worst and more likely scenario? Percy tries to get supplies and weapons but gets butchered by the Career Tributes. If he manages to escape, the Gamemakers notice when he stays away from all the fighting and camps near the lake, so they turn the water to poison or fire to keep things interesting."

Because Megamind is cannonically just in it for the fun and expects to lose. It's the whole reason he made Tighten. 10/10 he hams it up, Bob a seasoned super catches on that he's a harmless recurring villain, they exchange cheesey superhero dialogue, a decidedly one sided fight happens perfectly tuned to the Incredibles ability and Megamind goes to an easily escaped supermax jail where he prepares for the next ""fight"" Honestly I can't quite get the character interaction of Bob and Megamind out of my head. I think they would love each other. Megamind would be a perfect supervillain to let him relive his glory days without actually endangering himself or his family. His excellent presentation would probably do a lot of good for the weird PR situation going on in the Incredibles world.

"argumenta sobre: Superman VS the most efficient use of his powers in the irl world aimed to help people. If superman was part of the real world, catching criminals and saving people falling from buildings would be commendable, but I think his powers could be used in far greater tasks that can help humanity in a larger scale. In which ways you think Superman could use his powers to achive that kind of results? I've seen thrown around the idea that Superman could power a generator to give free energy, but that sort of solution is short sighted just because he is a person, and that comes with needs apart from regular sustenace that his power set covers, like not getting bored to death. He would need breaks and have time to live his life so a solution like that should be ruled out IMO.",There's a brilliant webcomic that involves this idea:
argumenta sobre: Tu-95 vs A-10 guns only dogfight Who would win in a dogfight between modern versions of the A-10 and Tu-95 if they can only use guns? Obviously it's an attacker vs a bomber which doesn't make much sense but they do both have guns meant to be capable of killing other aircraft and at least in the same ballpark of burst mass. 20 kg/s The Tu-95 is also quite a bit faster in a straight line meaning that it can probably prevent the A-10 from chasing it and the tail turret is radar-controlled i.e. it's an aimbot and has something like 60 degrees of traverse in all directions except only 40 degrees of depression. It only has about 500 23mm rounds as opposed to 1125 30mm rounds for the A-10 so clearly there is a lot less ammo for the Tu-95.,That fight indeed doesnt make any sense. If a-10 wants to kill tu-95 it has to go head on and never chase. if tu-95 wants to kill a-10 it needs to get it to chase it. I guess the bomber can just fly around till a-10 fuel runs out and then shoot it when it goes for a landing

Each gun gets 1 full clip of ammo a day, but can't refill until the next day. The guns fly as fast as the original bird did. A gun is dead when it's broken enough that it cannot fire a bullet, such as when it's snapped in half or the trigger is permanently jammed. The guns cannot be broken unless a human was directly involved. All rounds: Guns are human lusted. Round 1: Bird level intelligence guns Round 2: Human level intelligence guns Round 3: The guns can get any accessories they want and any ammo they can fire safely. Round 4: The guns can be military only or illegal firearms too, but it cannot be things like missiles or tanks.

I mean seriously is everyone ok with dying by some lunitic every few days? That aside, lets say Gothem, Batman the villains and everyone are all real. How would our government restore peace and civility and make Gothem a ""nice"" place to live. Is it even possible? Even places who suck balls to live in irl like Detroit do not have mass murderers running around everywhere. And genocide isn't carried out once every few days. Could anything be done about Gothems situation?","With all the metahumans, the first time Batman brings them in, the government would probably start experimenting on them in order to replicate their powers and make super soldiers. A spy with Clayface's powers would be the most useful espionage asset on the planet, with the ability to shape-shift into and imitate anyone. There is a lesser known Bayman villain naked Mr Bloom, who can give people superpowers, and has many himself. He can shoot fire, freeze objects, shape shift his fingers into blades that can puncture metal and kill humans. He can produce these seeds that if consumed, can give another person similar powers, and the more people ingest these seeds, the more powerful he gets. They would capture Mr. Bloom, Bane, Professor Pyg, Mad Hatter, and Mr Freeze, and get them to produce the labors of thier scientific exploits. The US would soon get access to things like super powered soldiers, freeze weaponry, and mind control devices. Professor Pyg is so skilled in surgery, he can graft a man's foot where his hand would be, and have the nerves still work and let him control it like normal. He has also given people minor super strength with his experiments. With Pyg's expertise, and Bane's knowledge on how to make venom, supersoldiers would pop up almost immediately. After they get Mr Bloom, they can use him to make even stronger superhumans with better powers. Croc wpuld probably be expiremented on for his strength, durability and healing factor. The US military would become exponentially more powerful, with venom enhanced soldiers, better weapons, mind control, new bioweapons with fear gas, and super-powered men and women that can shoot fire. A new world wide arms race would occur, with other countries trying to steal the research and specimens the US has to allow them to create super powers and all these new weapons. If they ever find out the secret to Poison Ivy's powers, they could create a surplus in food by creating larger, more efficient plants. They would probably take Joker to, for his immunity to toxins and laughing gas formula. Gotham would only be left with only organized and normal criminals, as all the ones with legitimate superpowers and the ones with advanced tech would be either kidnapped or assassinated by thr government."

We'll say the space marines are ultramarines and The Boys universe will put aside their differences to fight the space marines. Would a 5 man intercessor squad be enough?

I know compared to most stuff Homelander isn't that overpowered but he should be able to take out a few marines at least right?,"Do you mean just taking on the main Boys characters?

"argumenta sobre: Who would win: Kipchoge running a marathon, or 42 fresh Usain Bolts running 1 km each? Eliud Kipchoge runs a full marathon 42.195 km solo at his standard pace. Against him is a team of 42 Usain Bolts, each one running exactly one kilometer before being replaced by a fresh Bolt for the next. Every Bolt is in his prime and starts their leg fully rested. There are no delays between transitions. All participants run on a flat, paved course with standard road racing conditions. The competition is strictly about who finishes the full marathon distance first.","The bolts win pretty easily, I suspect. Kipchoge's record pace was 2:52 per kilometer. That equates to 2:17 per 800 meters. 2:17 for 800 meters is ""mediocre to bad high school runner"" times. If you believe Bolt, he says he ran 2:05 800s in training, which is not that hard to believe given that his 400 time is under 50. I don't see any chance that Bolt can't beat 2:17 once for 800 EASILY and stretching that another 200 meters for 1k would not add 38 seconds."

This is DCEU Batman. In Batman Vs Superman, Batman's motivation is the 1% chance that Superman decides to wipe out the entire human race. Here it's pretty much the same. Bruce has been monitoring Homelander and Vought for as long as possible without anyone else noticing. He is still a multi-billionaire with his companies and connections to the military which probably makes Vought think he's on their side. His sole goal is to defeat Homelander.

"argumenta sobre: Smaug vs IRS Smaug, known for his giant hoard of accuired riches, never paid any taxes on it. The Taxman comes calling assume the enitrety of Middle Earth is legally under IRS Can Smaug successfully protect his gold WITHOUT using any violence, with his words and possibly knowledge of law alone? Round 1: Smaug is cornered at his nest by the tax collector, after he failed to answer multiple summons. No prep time, the IRS agent is tax-lusted Round 2: Smaug has 6 months of prep time, and is given the entirety of the tax code in a dragon readable book form, as well as the entirety of Tolkien's books and notes. EDIT: After all your excellent responses I thought about it some more and came with another problem: What EXACTLY Smaug took from the dwarves? - at least a trillion gold coins worth of hard currency - at least several billion gold coins worth of jewellery, gilded works of art and precious cultural artefacts - an entire city of real estate - several different operational mines - probably the greatest industrial forge in the Middle Earth - several hundred smithies, casting equipment, and related industrial machinery - the palace of the King of the Mountain and the Vault - which were government property so, it was kind of a hostile privatisation? Smaug had not paid tax on ANY of it. In how much trouble does that put him?","I doubt the IRS in middle earth have any means of proving which way he acquired the gold, or whether he got it before or after tax codes were implemented. He could simply state he's acquired it before tax codes were implemented and they'd have no way to prove otherwise. With the tax code assuming that doesn't work, he could just claim that the gold he has was inherited from friends/family dragons. In the US only 12% of states have an inheritance tax, I doubt middle earth would have implemented one. A third option Smaug could take would be declaring the halls of Eribor an independent state via a Declaration of Independence, meaning he doesn't have to pay taxes to the IRS of a foreign power. And thus wraps up the three easiest ways I see Smaug weaseling out of paying his taxes."
"argumenta sobre: Will humanity survive if they were averaging 170 meters in size? no physical side-effects If humans were 100x bigger, like originally since 270,000+ years ago, will we even survive up to 2025? What would our lives and adaptations be like as absolute titans? There won't be any physical side-effects & difficulties like the obvious ""gravity crushing weight"", or ""can't breathe"", etc.. the humans and their remains simply scale by 100x and keep functioning on a relative level i.e. as if you're normal, this includes the height of fall damage being scaled by x100, dung size, red blood cells, movement speed, appetite, etc.. Just from a pure resource availability and compatibility perspective, how would or could humans survive on a tinier-looking Earth? Will we rely on literal wooden broccolis for food, will we overpopulate the Earth quicker, are we even able to make transistors in the first place, or will we die of hunger as soon as we get scaled up? \Note: To know what's that like for the American people out there: if we scale up the average person's height of 1.7 meters up to 170 meters x100 - that's like \1.83 Statues of Liberty tall, or about 50 average alligators, or almost 37 Toyota Corollas stacked on top of each other, or more accurately 895 bananas.\","So since square cube law doesn't count... I still don't think humanity would survive. Elephants would be relatively smaller than chipmunks. The tallest dinosaur ever would be 1/10th our height. A Blue Whale would be 1/5th. like the size of a small dog. Needless to say, meat is out of the question. even a few humans would eat every creature big enough to catch our notice into extinction. Plants aren't much better. Sure, there's more mass available, but the amount we'd have to eat every day, trying desperately to get enough calories out of... wood... which we are not built to digest, is staggering. Frankly, I'm not sure that even a lone human could possibly ingest enough calories in a day to not starve to death, much less have a breeding population manage to sustain itself."

"argumenta sobre: To spite anyone who thinks 2020 can't get any worse, gravity is doubled starting tomorrow 9/1 for the last 4 months. Can humanity survive? This means that it's harder to stand, harder to walk, everything functionally weighs twice as much, etc. Not only that, the stress placed on vehicles and structures by gravity is twice as strong, with all the issues that entails. The infirm now need that much more help to get by, and assumedly many animals with non-fatal terminal velocities now suffer fall damage. Etc etc. How broad is the devastation resulting from this, how do people cope, and can humanity survive until 2021? Edit: To clarify since I'm seeing confusion, on January 1st, gravity returns to normal. It's essentially a 4 month endurance round. Bonus Round: The gravity increments by 1x every month until the end of December.","The moon, the tides, earth's orbit, buildings, cities, towns are in chaos. If the entire Universe's gravitational constant doubled, many neutron stars, some within our own constellation, would create a singularity 5.972 × 10^24 kg/sq inch, subsequently resulting in massive bending in the space-time continuum. This would create black holes and supernovas, resulting in copious gamma ray bursts threatening our thermosphere and ionosphere. The event horizon for black holes would double, so they would be much more dangerous as well. The strength of the gravitational constant is what keeps the atmosphere and oxygen on Earth, preventing diffusion into the vacuum of space. Now the air would be significantly thicker at the surface of the planet. Thicker air results in larger insects, but they are the least of our worries. Our bodies and bicuspid valves are made for this gravity. We can last in less gravity with some acclimation, but not more, especially not double. We're fucked"

Batman won't find any of it funny and will consider it juvenile. But he doesn't really do ""pranks."" It's just not in his wheel house. Tony once turned a do good nerd scientist into a insane world dominating villain by pranking him to the roof. He stopped a conference with the entire media of America to eat a Whopper.

There are even more possibilities for how Ultron might have prepared that I'm sure will be debated in the comments Edit: Made this one after a few drinks so sorry for the grammer.

Both species have access to cloaking devices on their ships. butthe Klingons have build up an entire space infrastructure shipyards, outposts, sensor stations, multiple planets, mining stations etc to support their war effort with logistics. - The Yautja can use a faster FTL not sure how the opening sequence of AvP2 can translate to into hard data, otherwise it would be millions of light years in a matter of hours, vastly faster than any warp drive together with advanced wide-ranging sensors capable of scanning interstellar distances. - In ground fighting Klingons are usually superior compared to humans, but would loose to the Yautja, both in pure physical performance and typical loadout camouflage, sensors, energy weapons vs disruptors and bachlets together with conventional armour ... then again: orbital bombardment and transporter teleportation ... That goes probably to the Klingons quite easily, assuming that the Yautja is a smaller species without entire space fleets of warships or vastly superior space ships compared to Klingons warships.

"argumenta sobre: Dexter Morgan tries to kill Walter White, can Walter White get rid of Dexter before it's too late? Walter has knowledge that Dexter is gunning after him. Both have access to their resources. In Walt's case, he has his drug empire connections, Saul, Mike, Jesse etc. with Dexter having his resources from the Miami Police Department and his usual tools to kill someone. Both are at peak strength and power Who's coming out on top? Bonus rounds: Edit: Additonal round: Same scenario as round 1 Dex vs Walt but this time, Walt has no knowledge Dexter is coming after him. Rd 2: Dexter tries to kill Mike, can Mike Survive? In this case Mike doesn't have knowledge that Dexter is after him. Rd 3: Same as Bonus Rd 1, but this time Mike has knowledge that Dexter is after him. Who's winning each round?","Gotta give it to Walter white, I feel that Dexter's biggest advantage was always his mask of normalcy. WW has a genius level intellect, I think it's safe to assume he's smarter than Dexter, and has survived hits against him and his party. My guess is that Walter would be extra cautious at home, making it nigh impossible that Dexter would ever get the drop on him."

"argumenta sobre: Can we ban ""Saitama vs"" posts? Just a quick message to the mods because I feel like this is a pretty big issue. Every single time there's a post about Saitama vs some character like Goku or Superman or some other powerful character, it's always the exact same four types of comments repeated endlessly. 1 His feats are too bad, he'll lose. 2 He's a parody character so he can't lose. 3 We don't know how strong he is. 4 He's never taken damage but can't deal enough, so it's a draw. It's getting really boring considering that about 10% of the posts on here involve Saitama. Hopefully some people here agree with me when I say that I'm pretty sick of them at this point. I made this post before about Goku vs Saitama, same applies to every other fight with Saitama. Posting this to both and because they're both just identical subs with the exact same issues. Putting the flair as ""battle"" because there's really nothing good to put this as.","To everyone who want to ban characters from the sub: Don't participate in the post that include characters you don't like in battleboarding ! If you see a post with saitama, scps, goku or whatever you don't like DON'T CLICK ON THE POST and if you did click on the post for some reason DON'T COMMENT ! Its really not that hard.

"argumenta sobre: The movies from the fake trailers from Tropic Thunder get released in real life. Which does the best? The movies are with their respective real life actors - Satan's Alley: unironic drama about medieval homosexuals, starring RDJ and Tobey - Scorcher: average action movie starring Ben Stiller - Scorchers 2-6: average action movie sequels starring Ben Stiller - The Fatties: A ""comedy"" starring Jack Black and more Jack Blacks - Simple Jack: unironic drama about the life of an autistic boy starring Ben Stiller R1: Which makes the most and least money in the box office R2: Which gets the highest and lowest rating from critics R3: Can any of them win an oscar","Satan's Alley would be controversial and may get people to see it, it won't be a blockbuster but depending on word of mouth it will achieve success either in awards or renown. Scorcher and Scorcher 2-6 mirrors how a blockbuster 1st installment of the movie made so much money that more and more sequels were made. I feel Scorcher 1 was a blockbuster and made a lot of money, probably 2-3 as well, but 4-6 would just be the studio trying to cash in on the popularity of the franchise. The Fatties, if it was the 90s it could have worked, not so sure about now since comedies tend to include a lot of nuances now and simpler premises with gross-out factors don't exactly break the box-office anymore. Simple Jack, following how the in-world reception was about the movie was panned because of Tugg Speedman's performance and the premise. === R1: Which makes the most and least money in the box office Scorcher 1 makes the most money, maybe even Scorcher 2. I don't know if Scorcher 6 would have been affected by franchise fatigue, if so Scorcher 6 may have made the least money but I feel Simple Jack would have made the worst performance in the box office. R2: Which gets the highest and lowest rating from critics Satan's Alley highest. The Fatties and Simple Jack may have been panned. R3: Can any of them win an Oscar Academy Award Satan's Alley, hands down. Simple Jack won't because you don't go full r------. Scorcher probably on effects."

He discovered his superpowers and want to go rogue and cause chaos around the world and destroy Chinese, Russian and U.S military can he be stopped?","""Raising his power to the fifth"" means next to nothing when it's not easily quantified. If it's increasing his max measurements punching force, running speed, etc then sure, he'd be powerful, but without that exact quantification, it'd be tough to say. As a quick attempt on my break, here's some numbers I threw together: Lifting Strength: 150 lbs -> 75×10^9 or 76 Billion lbs Punching Force: 120 lbs -> 25×10^9 or 25 Billion lbs Sprinting Speed: 15 mph -> 760,000 mph or Mach 990 Reaction Time: 0.25 s -> 0.001 or 1 ms Durability is the real issue here since it's hard to give it a metric, but I'll break it into Structural Strength bone-breaking pressure: 1500 psi -> 7.6×10^15 psi or 7.6 Quadrillion psi Penetrative Pressure skin-breaking pressure: 100 psi -> 10×10^9 psi or 10 Billion psi So, with those vague estimates, here are some things he could do: - Lift 2% of all cars on earth simultaneously - Run around the earth in 2 seconds - Survive a mountain being dropped on them - From what I can tell, very likely bulletproof Funnily enough, their skin is their weak link, since their punch would almost certainly annihilate a lot of their skin and flash, but their bones would be intact. But yeah, they likely couldn't be killed by anything short of an ambush with a nuclear bomb or sufficiently large conventional explosion, given that their reaction time and speed are likely their greatest assets"

argumenta sobre: Spongebob and the Joker have to live together for a year. Who gets corrupted by the other first? For this scenario let's just forget about Spongebob's inability to survive in land. Both characters have to live in the same house and they are pretty much forced to talk and interact with each other for a year. Also remember that the Joker can't simply kill Spongebob because of his crazy regen abilities. Who would be the first one to have his personality completely changed?,"I think Spongebob takes this, just. The Joker is an insane genius and extremely manipulative. In saying that, I can't see him influencing Spongebob to be evil. Plankton fails to influence Spongebob in any meaningful way throughout the series and many of his attempts fail due to the sponges idiocy and/or kind nature. On the other hand, it wasn't hard for Spongebob to influence Plankton to be good in the F.U.N episode. I can see Spongebob annoying Joker, causing him to lash out. But every time the Joker lashes out to hurt him would be futile as Spongebob's durability is insane. The Joker would probably give in to his opponent out of desperation, probably saying something like 'if I go jellyfishing with you will you promise to leave me alone?'. This would probably continue until Joker actually enjoyed such activities with Spongebob, netting the Bob a win."

His goal is to defeat every character in Dragon Ball. Who is the strongest character that he can beat.,"Rick mostly has severe plot armour as the whole joke, but against basically anyone in Z he could conceivably die just by virtue of not being fast enough to react to any attacks they made, frankly…. The whole point of his show is ""he's always prepared perfectly unless it would be funny"" Meanwhile the Android saga shows us there is functionally no level of super science that can't be overpowered with raw oomph. So two answers- if we're running off RaM universe rules, he can kill anyone he wants pretty much. If we're running off DB universe rules, raditz probably splatters him before he can activate any plans."
"argumenta sobre: ""Zombie"" apocalypse but it's dogs and cats Instead of ppl turning into dumbass corpses, infected ppl turn into dogs and cats all different types, including animals like wolves and lions. The dogs and cats will not turn on each other like actual zombies. Dogs and cats will act like their animal self other than mindlessly pursuing humans. If a dog infects, victim turns into a canine and if a cat infects, they turn into a cat. Infection is via bite, scratch or excessive licking. Current dogs and cats will spread transmission and are now ""zombies"" but tbf, they won't spread transmission until 72 hours after initial attacks. Patients zero is a cute puppy in NYC in Central Park at peak times and another in Beijing as a stray cat during peak times. Ppl turn within 10 mins from bites or scratches, but excessive licking can take 24 hours provided the dog/cat saliva does enter the body and just stays on the skin. Does humanity survive? Bonus: humans that turn into cats and dogs still have their human brain/mindset. They can choose to side with humans by not ""infecting"" others. They can also now speak their native language. All current/wild dogs and cats will still be animals and try and turn humans. Edit: the cats and dogs are NOT zombies. They're normal cats and dogs. They act like their normal animal self. That's why licking is a way of transmission because a dog or cat can be affectionate that way",Normal cat bites are a major threat with modern healthcare. Rabid dogs kill thousands of people every year. Dogs are also just lethal to smaller humans. If they were all zombified that's the end of human civilization as we know it.
"argumenta sobre: Is there any fictional prison or asylum that actually can hold Batman within? We all know that Batman is one of the greatest escape artists ever in fiction. No way any real life prison or asylum, even a super-maximum security one, could hold Batman. But what about fictional prisons and asylums? Could it lock Batman up within so good that he won't escape from this no matter how hard he's trying or how really competent he is? Circumstances: Batman is wearing a typical prisoner orange jumpsuit and has none of his gear at all. He has no prep and knowledge about the prison either. He has no assistance and help for escaping too.

He's dropped into the Roman Coliseum, sand underfoot, sword in hand, armor gleaming with sweat and vengeance. On the other side of the arena? A 400-pound Silverback Gorilla, muscle-bound rage with fists that could turn a horse into a pancake. Rules: • No ranged weapons. Maximus has gladius + shield. • Gorilla has gorilla things. Teeth. Rage. Absurd biceps. • Both are bloodlusted. Maximus thinks the gorilla killed his family. • Gorilla thinks Maximus stole his bananas and insulted his mom. • Fight to the death. No gods, no gimmicks. Here's the real question: Does Maximus use his tactical brilliance, Roman grit, and plot armor to outmaneuver nature's tank and bury steel in ape flesh? Or does the gorilla rip this man in half like a scroll, toss his limbs into the crowd, and beat his chest over a new kingdom of blood? And considering Maximus is going to have his revenge — in this life or the next — how many lifetimes does it take before he finally beats the gorilla? 1? 5?

They have been in combat several times before and are well trained, but not considered ""elite"". Terrain is flat and lightly wooded. Just the tanks are fighting, no other combat units or air support around. Both the maus and the Sherman's have a mix of AP shells and HE shells. Maus is loaded to the brim with extra shells. Maus could hold 68 shells for the main gun and 100 for the secondary 75mm gun, but I imagine it could hold more if the crews tried to stuff it. Who wins?","Shermans. This isn't even close. Assuming an array of Shermans you have enough firepower between the American 75mm M5's, the 76mm M1 and the British 17-Pounder to destroy the Maus. It's simply too much concentrated fire. The Maus crew won't be able to do anything because their brains are going to be scrambled by constant fire from the Shermans until a Sherman Firefly destroys it from the side. Or the Shermans just disable the Maus' tracks so that the tank crew has to try and flee. Then the M50 Brownings on top of the Shermans kill the fleeing Maus crew."

"argumenta sobre: Could Naruto use talk-no-jutsu to talk down iconic horror villains? Some of these will most likely be a hard 'no', but I'm curious nonetheless. If a character is absolutely no, then Naruto can pummel them as many times as needed for months on end to make the killer lose the will to continue. Round 1: Jason Voorhees. This is the character that brought me to this idea. Jason is a lot more tragic than other horror villains, and is seen sometimes showing, er, compassion? I don't know if that's the right word. He spares kids IIRC, people who look like his mum, and even let a boxer take his best shots at him. Round 2: Freddy Krueger. Now, this one is absolutely a hard no, but talk-no-jutsu is often used after Naruto beats the antagonist to a bloody pile, so could Naruto continue to beat on Freddy, torment him or bully him, to make Freddy chill out or lose his fear factor? For example, Freddy was weak after being forgotten as seen in Freddy v Jason. Round 3: Micheal Myers. Granted, I don't know much about this character, but he's popular so I factored him in. Round 4: Art the Clown. This one is an even harder no, but similar rules as with Freddy. Could Naruto defeat Art time after time for the clown to eventually say ""fuck this"" and give up?","1- No. Deep down, Jason is a momma's boy, and he wants to do right by her. Which involves killing lots of people. Naruto won't even be able to pummel him into giving up; if dying and becoming undead won't stop Jason, nothing will. 2- No. Freddy's powers are tied to those who both know and fear him. Freddy's more likely to decide to haunt a village far, far from Naruto than to stop doing his thing. 3- No. Here's what his childhood psychologist had to say about a young Michael Meyers. >I met him, 15 years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this 6-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes; the devil's eyes. I spent 8 years trying to reach him, and then another 7 trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply… evil. And Michael Meyers has done nothing but proving the psychiatrist right. He only stops because Naruto has laid such a smackdown on Michael Meyers that his bones are liquified. 4- No. I don't think it's clear that art was at any point human. There's nothing for Naruto to talk to, and the best he can do physchally is likely make Art decide to torment people far from Naruto."

So i'll ask you guys what you think. The battle takes place in an open room, with no weapons.

He will only need one punch to knock someone out and he has the movement and skill to engage only 1 or 2 at a time.

Basically the man don't age, is immune to diseases and when he dies he just Respawn in the same spot he came from","Assuming the man is also immune from going insane from his isolation and immortality, his best bet would be to find an already intelligent animal such as a chimpanzee and selectively breed them over thousands/millions of years to create a race of sapient beings that are capable of forming a civilisation that can build the technology and infrastructure necessary for a return trip to mars. It's impossible to predict how long it would take the man to selectively breed an intelligent race; the last common ancestor between humans and chimps lived 6-8 million years ago though which could provide a very very rough estimate. However once the man has successfully bred a species that has intelligence comparable to humans, the heavy lifting is done. As long as the man ensures that his fledging civilisation worship him as a religious figure / deity, which shouldn't be hard given his immortality, then he just needs to hang around for a few thousand years until the civilisation develops the necessary technology and infrastructure to send him to mars and back."

"argumenta sobre: These killers are locked inside a building, who's the last one standing? A bunch of these characters randomly wake up in an empty office building let's say 15 stories tall and the only way to escape is to be the last one standing. Each killer wakes up on a different floor and have to find the others. Everyone has their standard gear Things like guns aren't allowed. Ghostface Scream, can be any Ghostface Edit: only from film canon Joe Goldberg You / Netflix Norman Bates Psycho films Hannibal Lecter Films Dexter Morgan Dexter Josef Creep franchise Patrick Bateman American Psycho Leatherface The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 Max Cady Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear Who wins?","First off, Norman Bates and Leatherface would be largely passive unless engaged by the others. Bates has a weakness for women, who excepting some Ghostfaces would not be present. Bates would just sit in their chair and not even bother trying to escape. Lecter, Bateman, or Ghostface have the charisma to use Leatherface as an attack dog to go after the others. Josef is not used to dealing with other psychopaths so his main dynamic of seducing innocents into his schemes wouldn't be effective. Max Cady is driven primarily by misogyny and revenge. Women are notably absent, as are any he has a direct beef with. He is prone towards violence but without his standard target pool he has nowhere in particular to vent his wrath. Anti-Semite Patrick Bateman would immediately hate the Jew Joe Goldberg, but his victims lack Goldberg's luck in killing serial killers. Goldberg, when faced with a serial killer invariably wins through luck and skill. Dexter has a similar knack. Ghostface's movie advantage of anonymity would be negated by everyone being a serial killer. Ghostface's stealth, durability, and strength would remain formidable. Hannibal Lecter is brilliant, manipulative and a skilled combatant. These two are individually the most formidable adversaries in terms of feats coupled with manipulation. Dexter and Joe would make strong allies given their shared altruistic bent towards serial killing. If they worked together they could be a match for any of the other combatants with the possible exception of Lecter. I would say the most likely survivor would be Lecter. He is the arch-predator. After that the Dexte team with Dexter having the stronger survival directive probably killing Joe, but could go either way. The third most likely scenario is Ghostface. The others have minimal chances due to their lack of experience in dealing with other serial killers."

Round 3: special forces are prepared by watching all Predator movies and train for 2 years to take it down. The Predators of the first two movies team up. No new tech just what we've invented by 2025. They take it on in a biome of their choiceUrban, Desert, tundra, Forrest, jungle","Round 1: If they have small drones, I think they're very useful. If they're allowed to do their thing, I think they could locate the predator. Could be way off, IDK what man portable drones can do. If the predator shoots at it, we have a general location. I'm still going 70/30 predator. Our biggest benefit is our technological development over the last almost 40 years. Round 2: Danny Glover did it. Special forces can. Maybe 50/50. Round 3: Special forces. They can set the field to something they're best prepared to handle. Not sure what it is, but whatever is closest to their training/prep. They could set the terrain to an abandoned base that they've specifically trained on for the last 2 years. They would know where to put traps and get them up immediately. Fortify a position ASAP, and get ready. 80/20 special forces."

"argumenta sobre: Prime Muhammad Ali vs 20 fifth graders armed with knives. Ali in his prime. Not bloodlusted,but giving maximum effort. Means the same thing as bloodlusted by the sub definitions. 5th graders fully understand that Ali is their enemy and don't get distracted. Maximum effortbloodlusted by sub definitions.They'll work together,but whether or not it's perfect is up to you. Kids are as fit as your average 5th grader I suppose. None of them are super athletic but none of them are unathletic completely. Kids have standard kitchen knives, sharpened. Takes place in an empty music classroomwhich comfortably fits 20+ people. There are chairs and desks. Start on opposite ends of the classroom. Victory via incapacitation to the extent that there's no chance to fight back or outright death. Bonus 1: Same conditions but in a gymnasium. Bonus 2: Ali gets a wooden bat for both scenarios. If it breaks, another one instantly replaces it. What changes? Who wins? Edit: If 20 is a stomp, reduce the number of 5th graders to 10.",Does the empty music classroom have chairs? I feel like Ali's chances go up if they have chairs. He can pick them up and throw them at kids and/or use them for crowd control if they are to remain planted where they stay.
"argumenta sobre: U.A High School My Hero Academia VS. Camp Half-Blood Percy Jackson Okay so before you guys start debating I just wanted to clarify a few things: 1. This battle is using the most current versions of U.A Manga and Camp Half-Blood Books. U.A is as it is during the school year and Camp Half-Blood is as it is during Summer. 2. All combatants are current. 3. Celestial bronze and other enchanted metals from the Riordan-verse will affect the students and faculty of U.A. However, weapons made from the enchanted metals will not turn the Heroes to dust upon injuring them, nor will they rip out their souls, or absorb their essence. They'll act just like regular super strong, razor sharp weaponry. 4. All manga feats are allowed for the students and Faculty. 5. Only named students and Faculty with specified quirks are allowed in this fight. This is to prevent debaters from theorising about what potential quirks the students in 1-C,1-D, 1-E, 1-F, 1-G, 1-H, 1-I, 1-J and 1-K may possess. 6. Since children of the Greek gods share similar abilities any feat-less, unnamed campers get the abilities of their siblings. 7. Since the exact number of campers at Camp Half-Blood during Summer When it has it's largest population is unknown I had to make some assumptions when calculating Camp Half-blood's population. In the The Trials of Apollo: The Hidden Oracle, Lester mentions that there are 20 beds in the Apollo cabin. Assuming each one belongs to a camper then there are 20 Demigod children of Apollo at camp. If we are assuming that each cabin has the same number of beds and that each belongs to a camper and factoring in the 20 cabins in camp Due to the addition of 8 minor god cabins at the end of The Last Olympian, then there are 400 campers at Camp Half-Blood during summer. Unfortunely the Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera and Artemis cabins are all empty. This means that we have to subtract 100 campers from our total. Now we are left with 300 Campers at Camp Half-Blood in summer. This actually lines up pretty well with the Books. In The Blood of Olympus it mentions that there were around 100 demigods at camp during the Roman's attack, 'A hundred demigods fanned out around her \Clarisse\ \...\' Page 429. Since this took place in August it's a safe bet that there are \100 campers at camp during summer. I am aware that I didn't factor in the fact that many of the Minor gods cabins barley have 5 demigods inhabiting them or the fact that The Dionysus cabin is also practically empty or that it has basically been confirmed that there are 30 Ares campers. This confirmation comes from the The Last Olympian when the Ares campers join the Battle of Manhattan '\…\ And a dozen war chariots charged into battle. \…\ A total of thirty fresh warriors, \…\.' Page 272... This is just an estimation so take it with a grain of salt If there is another example of the books mentioning how many campers there are, please let me know. 8. In rounds where both sides are allowed prep time they do not have access to the materials of the enemy's universe. 9. Basic knowledge means that they know what each enemy looks like and a general idea of what their powers are. 10. In battles where the Faculty are allowed, Percy gets the Curse of Achilles on top of his current stats. &x200B; Which side do you think will win in the following scenarios? Round 1: Students VS. Campers: Every named student Big three students included vs Every Demigod Camper Nico, Thalia, Frank and Hazel included Battle takes place in a Paintball field. Random encounter. Standard battle gear. Morals on. Round 2: Students VS. Campers again, I know. Battle takes place on a beach on Long Island, New York. 1 day prep time anything goes. Both sides get basic knowledge of the appearances, capabilities and abilities of their opposition. Morals off. Round 3: All of U.A Faculty included VS. All of Camp Half-Blood All allies allowed excluding Camp Jupiter, the Amazons, any non-Greek Mythology factions and, you know, the gods. Battle takes place in the U.S.J. 1 weeks prep. All gear and equipment allowed. Morals on. Bonus round: Which side can invade the others base of operations with the greatest efficiency? R1: It's a surprise attack! Takes place in the middle of the day. R2: The opposition knows that the enemy is coming. They get a months prep as well as basic knowledge on their enemies. Anything I missed? Any ideas on how to make each round more fair? Let me know in the comments and I'll add it in.","For morals off it is worth noting that unlike the demigods MHA has clear limits. Mirio fro example is explicitly said to be shoot out when he tries to re-materialise in matter. There is no reason that won't happen if the matter also has a soul. No such limit has been given to Percy. 90% of human body is water. Shinso may be able to mind control but Percy can just control his mouth not to open instead. And All Might may be able to clear the clouds but can Deku dissipitate a hurricane being actively maintained. Nico's skeletons can only be stopped by another child of Hades. Greek fire can't be put out. The Argus III can bombard from up high while Jason calls down lightning bolts. That's not even counting the Mist which any veteran camper knows how to use. Apart from AOE attacks all other would just miss, that's if they aren't confused into attacking each other. Todoroki's ice is no-sell due to Percy. Bakugou's is canonically seen to need multiple explosions to put down someone without durability enhancements. Compared to demigods who are regularly thrown into walls and fight giants without any ill effects, only his biggest attacks matter. Many of the faculties quirks can be easily denied. Eraserhead is good against criminals but against trained warriors whose powers can't be nullified, capture tape isn't going to do much. Jason or Percy can easily blow away the sleeping gas of Midnight. I really feel people are too biased in favour of BNHA. Also I would say prep time favors the campers. The Athena cabin is equivalent to multiple intelligence enhancing quirks. Nedzu could even the field but campers have multiple people so they can bounce off ideas and find flaws better. &x200B; Edit : Did not say this before but also their fighting styles. The demigods fight to kill and have killed gods, monsters and humans before. Their fighting style has been optimised over centuries. and they are taught by Chiron who has thousands of students worth of experience to guide them in the best possible way. In BNHA they specifically do their best not to kill and that translates into their skills. Plus each has a comparatively unrefined, unique style."
