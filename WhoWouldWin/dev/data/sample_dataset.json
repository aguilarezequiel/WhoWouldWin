    "output": "Given the fact that we can have Kowalski on analysis and Private on recon, this is a piece of cake. With billions of dollars to grease the wheels of bureaucracy, foreign or otherwise, they should have no problem extracting whatever information they need from the required sources. Adding an imperial fuck-ton of drones to the mix should speed things along a bit, so should be found within 48 hours. That gives them another 24 to kill Bin Laden. &x200B; I think Rico's storage is worth mentioning a little. He hasn't shown a lot of limitation in the movies. In fact, other than being unable to speak clearly, they don't really show us his storage limits. He seems to never eat anything that he coughs up although he probably is at some point? and yet can produce a lit explosive upon command. So this guy is no joke. He doesn't seem to choke on much either, even on bombs that are larger than both his beak and his head. So we'll forget physics or any sense of reality was there one here to begin with? and just assume that Rico can eat any individual item up to the size of an 18-wheeler, although he'd have to take a few minutes to cough it up, and seems to have a practically limitless capacity. He also doesn't seem to be weighed down with anything that he holds, either making him incredibly strong or giving him the ability to mitigate the physical properties of anything he eats. This is weird and not meant to be read into this far, so I won't go much further. Suffice it to say, he routinely coughs up things far larger than himself without batting an eye, and I'll just give Riko the limitations described above, with no adverse side-effects to himself. &x200B; In the movies we're seen plenty of stealthy infiltration, and given the penguins' small size it shouldn't be a huge problem to get into the compound quickly and silently. Additionally, Rico could basically store an armored division inside his stomach given what we see in the show, so equipment is not a problem here. We can probably be able to get an enormous amount of grenades of multiple types, at least 2 long guns and a sidearm, and plenty of ammunition to the penguins. &x200B; 2 days of prep should also be plenty of time to jerry-rig some sort of body armor for the penguins in case they do get in a firefight inside Bin Laden's compound, meaning their survivability drastically goes up. If everything goes even moderately to plan, they should get into close contact with Bin Laden without being noticed. Even if the plan is discovered, we're forgetting King Julian and Mort. They've shown themselves to be fantastic at destroying things in the movies, and armed with whatever it is that Riko can store in his stomach which, may I remind you, seems to have basically no limit they should have no problem annihilating anything that tries to escape. Given the penguins' skill at combat, however, combined with the fact that they're tiny, fast-moving targets, they should be basically impossible to take down accurately certainly not all of them at once, and almost ensures that at least one reaches Bin Laden. At that point, it's almost no contest. &x200B; To conclude,the penguins win. Perhaps with limited gear this could be a slightly bigger problem, but equipped and support the way that they are, they should be fine. They win in an outright firefight, which only occurs if they get spotted and don't catch Bin Laden with his pants down. In fact, given how their movies and shows played out, it wouldn't be uncharacteristic for them to wait in the bathroom undetected and quite literally catch Bin Laden with his pants down. &x200B; ^I took this way too seriously. I have homework I should have done instead of writing this."

    "output": "Ah good twist. If they had to kill him and this is an R rated version of the Penguins, they for sure could. Finding him would also be easy for them. Taking him out of there alive would be quite the challenge. If anything they'd probably employ Julian to be a pet monkey. He could sneak about undetected until he reaches Bin Laden's room. Julian wakes him up and distracts him Julian being unaware of course, he's been told that he has a meeting with a great world leader. He presents a bottle of juice not knowing that the juice he was given by the penguins had been poisoned. Bin Laden is sleep deprived and thinks he's still dreaming - a monkey is going to pour him drinks. He drinks the whole bottle not enough poison total to kill him. The guards hear Julian after a few minutes and walk in to find Bin Laden poisoned and unconscious. As Bin Laden is flown away to a hospital or place with the antidote by helicopter, the penguins jump out of their hiding places and take control. Rico throws up the first aid kit with the antivenom. They throw Mort into the propellers of the following helicopter, throw the dynamite at the caravan below and make a run for it until they reach US territory. King Julian becomes the leader of al-Qaeda."

    "input": "10 average sized twelve year old American boys vs 1 average American adult male. So, I got into it with some guys in askreddit and I just want to see what you guys have to say about this. I'm being 100% serious. Specs for our 12 year olds are going to be based off my google results for the average stats for that age, so it's looking like our 10 unsung heroes will be standing at 4'9 and weighing in at a whopping 88 lbs. Let's also say that our 12 year olds aren't necessarily cream of the crop ball players but that they all have experience being forced to play various sports throughout their younger years. No athletic freak future nfl anomalies among them, but they're all decently familiar with physical exertion and there aren't any McLovins out there just waiting to get murked. Since we're talking averages here, let's say none of them have physically fought anyone at this point in their lives, so no real fighting experience. But, assume they've all seen every avengers film, they each have an older brother that's forced them to watch Dragonball Z cell and frieza sagas, and they each saw the second Rush Hour on Tbs when they were children and went through a brief period of pretending they were kung fu practioners as a result. For our beloved average joe I'm gonna take the literal average American male. This means our fearsome apex predator is going to stand 5'9 inches tall and his weight will round out at 196 lbs. At the time of the altercation Joe will be 36 years of age, and despite repeated assurances from his wife that she still finds him attractive, for the past 7 years he's found no success in his desperate attempts to decrease the circumference of his 40 inch waist. According to Joe, he peaked athletically at age 23 after having played intramural soccer for several years while pursuing his bachelors in Business Administration. He also lifted weights in college off and on but was largely inconsistent outside of a few disciplined and motivated 3 month stretches. Although admittedly sporadic, when Joe did weightlift he was always sure to steal his roommates well reviewed protein powder, and would often resort to using the cheap walmart brand powder to replace what had been taken. He was never caught. Sadly, Joe's white collar desk job and soul crushing commute have left him largely sedentary for the past 10 years. Over this time period Joe's physical fitness accomplishments have consisted of signing up for the local annual 5k and subsequently failing to attend, as well as his consistent yearly gym appearances immediately following increasingly desperate, regretful, and overconfident New Year's resolutions. R1: The fight will occur in a gladiator style arena with our combatants starting opposite of one another. Everyone involved is wearing standard athletic gear gym shorts, jogging shoes, t shirt. This is a fight to the death and everyone present is aware of this. The 12 year olds are not necessarily blood lusted but they are committed to the fight and will only stop if incapacitated. All I mean by this is that even though they can't be scared into running away and abandoning the fight by maiming one of them in front of the others, they're still normal 12 year olds and won't be attacking like World War Z zombies with complete wreckless abandon and disregard of their own safety. But like I said, the kids are 100% down for the cause and fully understand the life or death stakes. Neither side is given prep, the situation is revealed just before the fight begins. Who wins R1? Is it a close fight or a curb stomp? R2: Joe is given 4 weeks to prepare mentally and physically for the battle. He is informed that he will fight 10 twelve year olds to the death and is given a photo of the venue but everything else in the prompt remains the same. The children will still enter the arena with no idea of what's to come. Does this change the outcome? R3: The Rock has decided to volunteer as tribute in place of our sweet Average Joe. He is not aware of any info about the fight and will be 100% clueless until the fight begins. The 12 year olds however are given 8 weeks to prepare for the battle but cannot receive outside strategic counseling from anyone other than one of the 10 that will fight. They will know that The Rock is their opponent and they'll be allowed to practice in the arena before the battle. Nothing else changes. Can they smell what The Rock is cooking and live to share the tale with their children's children?",
    "output": "Since you've stated you're serious I'm going to provide an answer that isn't entirely speculation here. I have a large family and at a family reunion I was horsing around and wrestling with a bunch of my younger cousins. There were just over a dozen \\10-12. Battling the kids was a joke. I was in pretty good shape and had 8 years experience with competitive wrestling. But fighting them was so easy I don't think the fitness or experience was required. I was tossing kids around. Using kids as shields. Tripping kids into each-other and over each-other for legit hours. The kids weren't holding back either. They are just weak. All three rounds go to the adult no problems. Curb stopped."

    "output": "Ooh this looks fun lets get into it. R1: 10 year olds take this 10/10. 4'9\" and 89 lb. puts them at decently lanky and they would swarm average Joe easily. AJ is not NEARLY fit enough to deal with them. While AJ is big, he lacks the muscle and endurance to take out all of them R2: I would put this at 5/10 AJ. With four weeks of prep AJ could learn the basics of most martial arts and develop his endurance enough to last the whole fight. Given that AJ used to be pretty fit he could get back into shape pretty easily and could probably take on the 10 12 year olds unless the 12 year olds can develop a strategy right then and there. R3: Rock 10/10. The Rock is 6'4\" and 240 pounds of literally just muscle. No matter what kind of training the 12 y/o's go through they'll all be knocked out from one hit from him. 8 weeks is enough for the kids to gain a decent amount of endurance and muscle but not nearly enough to survive a. being hit by The Rock, b. being able to hold down the Rock, or c. deal enough damage to incapacitate/kill him."

    "output": "It's a logistical nightmare. I'm not sure how they will keep their forces from starving. If we pretend they don't all starve to death, I give it to Napoleon's forces 10/10, because it will be relatively easy to carve a command structure out of a group of 20 year olds. Further, some of them will have combat training or recreational fighting experience, and he can build a training cadre from that. After about a week and a half period of reduced effectiveness from cocain withdraw, Napoleon should have implemented a jangling and inefficient chain of command with several training units, all of which can be refined as he builds his fighting force. I expect his priorities are shifting towards resource acquisition and intel by the end of the month. Alexander's forces will be starving and there will be wide-spread illness. A small core of his force very close to him are beginning to develop a command structure, but most of their time is spent trying to bring the horde of starving, diseased twelve year olds into the fold and manage the politics of such a large and poorly coordinated group. I expect his priorities will remain food and disease control as a means to maintain cohesion and moral right up until the fight, which he loses badly."

That's the beginning of puberty compared to the peak or past the peak for most men and women. Not to mention that cocaine is a huge performance enhancing drug, it would let them fight without fear and pain, assuming they have enough to keep them going throughout the fight. You could replace Napoleon with Forrest Gump and the answer is still the same, they don't even need any real tactics or strategy to run over the 12 year olds."

    "output": "Taking this a bit more seriously.... A gorilla who's learned all martial arts isn't as powerful as it sounds. Their body just isn't as flexible as a human's, they lack our degree of rotation in many of their joints, and simply can't be as agile as a human. What use is capoeira to a gorilla? Even with perfect comprehension, it can only perform a crude approximation. The skills a human needs to throw a strong punch just aren't applicable to a gorilla's body. That said, Kong Fu will still be quite a bit more deadly than a normal gorilla, and I expect that to show up most starkly when fighting multiple opponents. The ability to track and respond to multiple threats at the same time is absolutely a part of many martial arts, and absolutely something Kong Fu will benefit from. Reaction time, ability to read and predict threats, knowledge of weak points and leverage... there's definitely a lot it'll gain. I think it could handidly defeat a whole tribe of gorillas simultaneously. I think it could predict and react in time to stop a venomous snake's strike. I'd put money on it against anything up to twice its mass, through prediction and leverage. However, I do think it would struggle against anything more than twice its mass that specialize in \"alpha strikes\". Some attacks are easy to predict but need to be evaded or overpowered, and Kong Fu just isn't as agile as a human with a gorilla's strength would be. If he can't immediately overpower it and can't dodge it, he's going to take damage, and at a certain point something is going to bull rush him and he'll just get yeeted. Yote? W/e."

    "output": "The bears should be able to pretty easily defend the wall. Uruks are, at best, only slightly stronger than men. Polar Bears won't notice the diffence. The Uruks would need to heavily outnumber them to do any damage, but since the polar bears can easily kill Uruks faster than the Uruks can climb ladders, there's no chance. I'd put Wick up on the wall with 75 polar bears Wick is up there for insurance -- if there's a freak accident and the Uruks do start massing somehow, he can lighten the numbers a bit before a bears charges in. I picked Wick rather than Legolas because he's got a scoped rifle. This is kind meta -- we know he has to shoot the blasting charge guy, but Napoleon wouldn't. IMO it's justified, because you'd want him up there to snipe out the enemy general. Speaking of, he definitely snipes out the enemy general. 25 Bears in the front gate is enough to cycle a dozen at a time. I don't think the Uruks would have a chance to mob them, as the front gate isn't that wide really. Natasha and Legolas spend most of the fight keeping an eye on the bears, shooting anybody that looks like they're going to set a spear or pull any other tricky anti bear moves. Toss spongebob into their ranks at the beginning of the fight. He's only around for an hour, and his toonforce is stronger he more comically overmatched he is. Might as well expend him ASAP.

If hand to hand combat came into it, like I said if he's blood lusted he is a master of karate and the uruks probably wouldn't learn so eventually they would just smother the uruk army, even after turning into sponge there is now a massive wall of sponge to fight through and Wick and Legolas' range/ fire power overcomes a lot of that.

Natasha from infinity war The bears will be loyal to napoleons every command.",
    "output": "Napoleon is in deep trouble. Helm's Deep is a fortress that was originally held by 2,000 people. Now, a hundred perfectly obedient, perfectly disciplined polar bears might be better than two thousand Númenóreans in terms of raw combat power. What they are not is flexible. They can't operate machinery like drawbridges, portcullises, and cauldrons of boiling oil. They can't bandage and tend to each other when some are inevitably injured. They can't use missile weapons like bows and crossbows- and this gives up a really substantial advantage of a defending force holding a fortress, since they can't bleed the attackers from the safety of elevated walls as they advance across open ground. John Wick, Natasha, and Legolas are individually impressive, but won't be able to match the weight of fire of hundreds of archers. Without thumbs, they can't even really lift and throw rocks. Also: one polar bear cannot reasonably expect to hold the same amount of ground as twenty Numenorians. Every Uruk-Hai getting to the top of a siege ladder within five feet of a polar bear is going to get summarily wrecked, but they'll be spread mighty thin on top of that wall, and the bears will be playing a losing game of Whack-A-Mole. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly: even if the bears are perfectly loyal and perfectly disciplined, following Napoleon's every command, they can't meaningfully communicate back to him. Napoleon has command of exactly three...and a half...actual people who can communicate. And he is, exclusively, a French-speaker! Of his troops, John Wick speaks English, Russian and Italian. Movie-Legolas speaks English, Quenya and Sindarin- and if he's book-Legolas, he's even more shit out of luck, since Adûnaic replaces English. SpongeBob is an exclusive English-speaker and only marginally sane or useful to communicate with at the best of times. Only MCU Black Widow, as a cinematic superspy, would be expected to know French. This is a very big problem. A battlefield is not a Total War game, where the general has a God's-eye-view of every detail of the proceedings at all times: he needs junior officers to relay the details of how a battle is going. Worse, Napoleon is defending an unknown fortress: he has no maps, no real idea of the layout or surrounding terrain. And with only an hour to prepare, he has no real hope of getting an idea of how Helm's Deep is constructed before the battle has begun. Also, since he's not a modern Western adult, he has no frame of reference for Spongebob's 'Toon Force'. He has never seen or heard of a cartoon, never even known anyone who has. His potentially strongest asset is thus almost entirely useless to him- knowing SpongeBob, quite possibly even actively counterproductive. This battle does not play to Napoleon's strengths. A genius with the use of light artillery, he has no artillery whatsoever- not so much as the few scattered trebuchets that were present at Minas Tirith. An inspiring and charismatic leader, he has exactly one person who can understand him speak, and the main body of his troops are basically automatons who don't need inspiring. One of the preeminent geniuses of early modern, black powder warfare, he is commanding a force with precisely three guns. A noted proponent of swift maneuver warfare who was at his best in an audacious attack, he is left to defend a static fortress. Honestly, given the constraints he's under, I think a field battle might be his best option: march the bears out of the gates. Hide ninety of them behind a hill, station ten of them on top of the hill with orders to guard John Wick, Legolas and the Black Widow. Stick the three of them behind pavises dug out of the armory or improvised from whatever wood they could find, instruct Wick to start things out by sniping officers from a distance with his scoped rifle. Wait for the enemy to approach, instruct Legolas and Natasha to open up with bow and pistol with one shot every ten seconds, shouting 'ALL ORCS ARE BASTARDS.' Wait for the charge, meet it with the other ninety polar bears coming over the hill, instruct the ranged trio to switch their emphasis from sniping/harassment fire to sheer volume, hope that the combined shock of a surprise polar bear charge and automatic weapons fire is enough to break the frequently shaky Uruk-Hai morale and unit cohesion. Station Napoleon at the top of the hill, have him carefully observe how the Uruk-Hai react and direct charging polar bears at the spots of their line that waver. Leave the sponge at home. It's not a good plan, but it's the best Napoleon is likely to implement given these constraints. He takes it maybe three or four times out of ten."

Wick and Legolas are just such effective killing machines that I think they'd get it done before the Uruk-Hai are able to land a single blow upon either of them. Two side questions that would help me answer more thoroughly - how common are Uruk-Hai archers, and overall how many rounds does Wick have?"

For him to survive such ludicrous acceleration of a moon jump without immediately liquefying his durability is likely off the charts.

We have seen in recent cultural climates that being overly intellectual is seen as a negative. People don’t want to elect someone who doesn’t seem relatable. It’s a common sentiment that intellectuals live in metaphorical ivory towers and don’t understand the plight of the common man. Because of this, it’s a landslide victory for Urban Dictionary Man Edit: as many people have pointed out, 17th Century Man may also have trouble communicating in his outdated language. While this hurts him with intellectuals, to the common voter, they don’t really care if what he says makes sense, just that he sounds aloof.

    "output": "I believe people are seriously underestimating the Roman legions. First, let us talk about the size of the Roman Army under Trajan. The largest number I can find for the orcs is 250k at Pellanor Fields. This represented the vast bulk of Sauron's strength, if memory serves. The Roman Legions under Trajan are estimated to be around 350-400k. Keep in mind that a large majority of these troops are battle-hardened career soldiers. While there may be initial shock value in the first engagement, the hallmarks of the Romans were adapting their tactics to suit their enemies. The Romans developed sophisticated methods to deal with war elephants, for example. It is unreasonable to assume they would not do the same for Mumakil etc. Keep in mind that Mumakil where effectively routed by a force of 6,000 Rohirrim cavalry. To say that the Romans are not capable of the same with their already established superior number is ludicrous. As to the orcs themselves, they are usually portrayed as generally being inferior to men in their fighting abilities. They have less morale, fighting skills, and arguably worse equipment then then the Romans. They lack the discipline, unit cohesion, and fighting experiences of the Romans. While Mordor would be able to make initial strides with what I would consider specialized shock troops, they would soon be cut off and surrounded as Mordor's basic line infantry falls to legionnaires. Keep in mind the martial mentality of the Romans, these are the people who lost an estimated 50-70k men at the battle of Cannae. To put that in perspective, the Romans took as many causalities in ONE DAY as the United States took in the ENTIRE VIETNAM WAR. Further consider population levels at the time: loosing 60k men when the entire population of Rome was around 400k was an enormous loss. This is also not counting the casualties they had already sustained from Trebia and Trasmine which approximates to around an additional 40k losses. Even after sustaining these horrendous loses against arguably the greatest general in history, the Romans absolutely refused to surrender. They went so far as to outlaw grieving in the city itself. After these setbacks, the Romans adapted their tactics weird! and continued fighting for another 10 years before finally claiming victory. This should give a small glimpse into the absolute single-mindedness of the Romans--they will not be intimidated, they will not back down, and they will not cut and run. You will have to kill each and every single one of them to defeat them. Ok, that last sentence was a bit of hyperbole, but you get the point. So before this gets any longer: 1. Unless Mordor can effectively disorganize and completely rout the Roman army in the opening engagement of the battle, they will be outmaneuvered and defeated. 2. Without the prospect of a decisive battle to thoroughly defeat the Romans, this is even worse for Mordor, again they are defeated. 3. While Sauron's presence greatly enhances the capabilities of Mordor, if he does not have the ring, the Romans still win. Albeit with significantly greater casualties. Ninja edit: also people, think about how Mordor has to advance through the fire OF THE ENTIRE ROMAN ARTILLERY CORPS. Think of the beginning of Gladiator, now multiply that by a thousand. Edit: I figured I would hop back in and address some points that people brought up. The reason I left the Nazgul out is due to their small numbers. While yes they would undoubtedly cause hundreds if not thousands of Romans to flee, there are only 9 of them. Their numbers are far too small to affect the outcome of a battle involving perhaps 1 million plus combatants. In fact, in some regards the Witch King is wasted as a combat asset. He is of far more value actually commanding the armies of Mordor than as a combatant. As to the points of the nine attacking the Roman artillery positions, while this sounds good in theory, in application it has major issues. 1. The numbers they are attacking. There is only 9 of them, and while they may be extremely difficult to kill, the felbeasts are not, relatively speaking. You cannot logically say that felbeasts will survive tens of thousands of archers, scorpions, and ballistas shooting at them. 2. Assuming that they survive the fall from the felbeasts, they are now cut off and surrounded by literally the entire Roman army. They will kill dozens, hundreds, hell, maybe thousands, but eventually Pullo will throw a pilum through the back of the Witch King's hood, or he will catch a ballista bolt to the chest. 3. Even if they couldn't be killed, do you understand how large a battlefield this is going to be? One side of the army will have no hope of even seeing the other side, let alone the middle. In the amount of time it will take them to walk around and kill everyone, the battle will be long over. Mumakil: these are honestly the best hope Mordor has of winning, but they still have a number of critical weaknesses that I think the Romans would be all too happy to exploit. 1. The Romans don't need to kill the Mumakil--they just need to panic them. In fact this was one of the primary strategies the Romans employed against actual war elephants. Someone may correct me if I'm wrong, but is not this essentially what the Men of the West do in the battle of the Pelanor fields? 2. The Mumakil are extremely tough, but the riders are vulnerable to a shot from an arrow, balista, or scorpion. The Romans will no doubt seek to exploit this. 3. An extremely good historical point was made below that the use of catapult on the battlefield was not exactly a thing until the Mongolians pioneered it. However, we must consider that the entire Roman army is here, which means all of their siege equipment. When Flavius Flave sees the giant building-size elephants bearing down on them and he has a onager that can hurl massive stones designed to crush city walls, or pots filled with combustible liquids tell me one of those on the face of an Mumakil would not panic it, is it that hard of a logical leap to make that he might decide to use them on the Mumakil? Even then, I have a hard time imagining a ballista bolt could not pierce the hide of a Mumakil. Remember, necessity is the mother of invention. People seem to not know what I mean when I reference elite shock units. From the historical perspective these where units designed to cause overwhelming casualties and morale \"damage\" by executing devastating charges into infantry formations. Historical units that fit this classification are: Cataphracts: Scythed Chariots Syrian or Africa Forest War Elephants: War Dogs The point is that most of the elite units of Mordor armored trolls, Mumakil, and Nazgull fit this exact description hence why I referred to them as elite shock troops. Their power lies in their initial charge as it breaks up formations and causes panic. This is perhaps the number one thing that Roman Legionaries drilled to prevent. Desertion or running from battle was punished by being beaten to death with clubs by the men of your own unit that you put in danger. I am not saying that Legionaries could not be broken or forced to rout--far from it--but to assume that it would be \"easy\" is a gross underestimation of Roman training and military tactics. Orc canon fodder tactics are common throughout the books, in fact, I don't think there is a single case where the Men of the West outnumber their enemies in the entire series. Orc strategy usually involves overwhelming the enemy through sheer numbers. Even if we are to assume that Mordor has a 2-1 advantage, which I believe it has been thoroughly established that they do not, then this is not nearly enough to adopt this kind of strategy. Also keep in mind when armies get this large they cannot all possibly fight at the same time, as there is so many people there is just simply not enough room. This means that while the front lines are fighting the legionaries, the back is constantly being shot to shit by archers etc. The initial orc forces are also going have to deal with the largest pilum what would be the proper pluralization of this? volley in history. Pilum: OK. I finally think that is it. As I said before, if Mordor can break the Legions in the opening engagement of the battle, they can win. I think they have virtually no chance of pulling this off. I am not saying that Rome will not take heavy or even extraordinarily heavy casualties, but the historical records shows that taking massive casualties, usually causes the Romans to fight harder not surrender or rout. The Romans also have war pigs, nuff said. edit: I actually went back and did some proofreading. I apologize for any eyeballs that people may have lost. edit: last edit I swear, since this post has become so popular, I feel obliged to point out there are some historical inaccuracies in how I have the Legions fight. 1. Firstly, field artillery was not really a thing around the time of the Romans. Considering the circumstances of OP's scenario, I simply felt that it was logical that the Romans would use them instead of just leaving them to acquire dust. 2. Gladiator is a very historically inaccurate movie. The way the Germanic Barbarians are portrayed for example is laughably inaccurate, also Legionary helmets. 3. Since I was intoxicated when I initially composed this post, I counted the Roman Legion's as consisting of only Roman Legionaries. In reality about half of the strength of the Legions where comprised of Auxilia units. 4. Also, I am sorry, Flavius Flave is a highly fashionable Roman of my own making. Information on the Auxilia for those who desire it: I have been gifted internet Aurum! Thank you kind Senators!"

    "output": "If the Romans know what is coming, have time to prepare and they don't face anything they literally couldn't kill: Balrog, Nazgul etc they have a chance here. As this is a fantasy scenario I will accepted all the legions being there but in reality it wouldn't be possible to muster all of them in one part of the empire. Some of the estimates here are perhaps a little steep but the full Roman military of this period would consist of a few hundred thousand at the very least. Man for man the Romans vastly outclass their opponents in all areas: training, discipline, leadership, equipment, morale. The Romans will also be far better led, especially if Sauron or the Nazgul are not there, The Romans will also have time to prepare for Mordor, something they were rather good at. We can also expect the forces of Mordor to aggressively attack which should play right into the hands of the Romans. Earthworks, artillery and fortifications can be built and will help nullify some of Mordor's major threats. In any sort of scenario where the legions are one on one with the Orcs in a straight fight the Orcs get slaughtered. The wargs are terrifying but they die fairly easily to swords, spears and arrows and don't seem to exist in large numbers. While the trolls would be terrifying with some preparation and massed use of artillery or pila they could be brought down. The mumakil are perhaps the only serious problem you list and seem like an insurmountable problem. However in the film the massed arrow fire of Faramir's rangers is enough to deal with multiple mumakil. Look at how the Romans dealt with elephants when they fought them against Pyrrhus at Asculum. You don't have to kill the mumakil, just panic them and make them run in the other direction. Overall I think that the Romans could win the day as long as they prepare and can hold out against the initial terrifying onslaught. The other scenario is that the combination of Mumakil, trolls etc rout a significant part of the Roman forces and they are butchered."

Plankton, storms out of the Chum bucket upon hearing that Gordon has done this only to be chased by Gordon. They eventually work through the issue and make the compromise that plankton can keep his laboratory but it must be diminished slightly for the kitchen to take priority. After a few weeks the Chum bucket is looking sick and span. His restaurant has been done up and now looks modern and welcoming, furthermore the kitchen is now productive and sets high priority on being clean. The night after this is finished, Gordon Ramsey informs plankton that in the next day, they will tackle the food and make any necessary changes. That night, plankton, looking for a quick and easy answer, goes on an escapade to steal the krabby patty secret formula. Gordon catches him on the way over and proceeds to yell at him and scald him. The next day, they tackle food and come to the conclusion that the reason people won't eat there is that he emphasises the fact he is serving chum which obviously isn't appealing to fish and Gordon highlights this as the key problem. They rename the restaurant 'Plankton Authentic Eatery'. Then they work on touch up dishes served from being plates of chum to a restaurant of wide and varying options. It involves Spaghetti Chum Bolognese and Chum and Chips and Chum Burger. Fish are a lot less off out by this and plankton starts to earn a lot of money. Soon after this Gordon leaves. However plankton is still not earning as much as Mr Krabs. This kills him, although he has a very goo way of life now it's not wanted and he can't stand that although he shares business with the krusty krab, they are doing better. Within months he goes back to his old ways. He changes the name back, expands his lab and allows his restaurant to become delapodated.

The real limiting factor is that Plankton is unlikely to quit his supervillian bullshit just because Ramsey is around trying to fix his business. Plankton will wind up doing something outside the realm of the restaurant proper that results in the police hauling him off or the heroes kicking his crap in. This is only going to be accelerated by the fact that Ramsey is filming everything and will get Plankton's ranting on camera. It's not a question of \"can Ramsey fix the business,\" it's a question of \"can he fix the core problem of the business being owned by a supervillian who only superficially cares about the success of the business.\""

With the muskets, it becomes being trained with the weaponry. Even then, if Bonaparte can lead the army, he might be able to pull something off due to his numerical advantage. Also, wasn’t Napoleon Bonaparte an artillary officer? Not to cast aspersions, but his intellect and stategic savvy do not necessarily indicate any particular physical prowess. And he was relatively short, so assuming peak physical condition, he still has a considerable size advantage against Dynamite."

Lucas could theoretically destroy all copies within a few months, assuming he has no problems with breaking into Star Wars geeks' place of residence. I don't think the police will be much of a problem, Lucas can easily afford to bribe every officer he comes across. However, this is assuming that no new copies are being made. If some Star Wars fan is Special-lusted, they simply have to produce the videotapes at a rate faster than 20 copies per minute, and Lucas will never be able to destroy them all. Of course, if he does not have to personally oversee the destruction of every copy of the special, then it's trivially easy for Lucas to win.

    "output": "I'll start this off with something... Off topic/Meta. I agree. This entire subreddit is just generic stuff like \"John Wick is transported to 2012 in the MCU. Can he take over the whole planet?\" So i'm gonna say, this is very refreshing. On to the non-meta stuff! R1: The density of the Elephant hasn't changed, and neither has the durability, but for the Crab... It would make sense for it's strength to increase in proportion to his size, and once a crab grabs you... It likely won't let go. See, as a former Crab nerd, i'd list off the different types of Crabs that have an edge in this situation, but, it doesn't matter. In my personal opinion, Crab wins, 6-7/10. R2: The Crab is just straight up powerless here, in any given situation. First off, i'll assume you mean the... aforementioned MCU version of Mjolnir. This version of Mjolnir is crazy powerful, and the Crab is finished in a few hits. Assuming the Crab doesn't hit the Elephant with the gun first, Crab looses. If we're talking COMIC Mjolnir, Crab's really screwed, possibly more than before. If you mean the Mjolnir of Norse legend, the Crab. Will not. Last. A second. This thing can level mountains in a single goddamn swing. Don't fuck with mythological Thor. Elephant wins 10/10, 10/10, and like, 100/10 on the last one. R3: Thanos, in the comics at least, isn't too terribly powerful compared to comic Darkseid. He has all kinds of stuff though. Super strength, INSANE LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE, Telekinesis, but in the end, Darkseid is far superior to him. Even with \"The Infinity Gauntlet\" that everyone has lost their collective minds over, Darkseid Elephant wins 10/10, every time. Because Darkseid does not yet have a cinematic version, and MCU Thanos isn't as strong as comic Thanos, i figured i'd make things more fair by using comic Thanos. I'd do the bonuses but i have important 70's punk rock to attend to."

Spiderman or Nightwing? Stuff like that. One of the reasons I love this sub so much is it reminds me of being a young teenager and just arguing back and forth with my bestfriend about this stuff. And to us Stan Lee was one of our heroes. So anyways, onto my little story Someone asked Stan what he thought was the secret to the MCU's success. And he said \"well, it's me! The people come to see me!\" And he smiled and all of us smiled back too and laughed a bit. He said \"My cameos make the movies. People go and watch the movie and they enjoy it and then they say 'oh shoot! Quick! To the box office! We missed Stans cameo!\" He was such a funny and charming man, and he made a whole room full of people in a book store laugh with his jokes. I'll always remember this one joke in particular every time I see one of his cameos. I will miss him but I'm glad we got to hear one of his jokes & have him sign our books. It's a memory me & my bestfriend have cherished to this very day. RIP Stan ❤️"

While he did let out a painful groan afterwards, implying he survived the initial crash, his rebreather inexplicably got knocked off of his head as well. There’s a 99% chance that he drowned soon after, given that he is at the bottom of the ocean with no support team in sight. other than a second cameraman who didn’t even bother to help. what an asshole. If we give Spongebob prep time, he could drive into the Cameraman again if he can blindside him, or at least catch him off guard.

His height probably translates into a much better range. --- Pete's Dad is severely obese according to BMI, and about 130lbs overweight. He is much shorter, so his range is probably shit, especially with that gullet. His heavy alcoholism means that a light buzz is probably an intense amount of alcohol. It also means that those 4 years are probably a huge factor. Heavy alcoholic and morbid obesity probably mean this guy is going to die within the next 10 years. His only real advantage is that this guy seems like a mean sonofabitch and has probably seen some fight experience. I think this goes 9.5/10 to your dad.

    "output": "Never. It isn't as though Thanos wants to do it. He isn't driven by a desire for power, to be a god or even status. He threw his daughter, the only being in the universe that he loved, off of a cliff. He is dedicated to the cause because he isn't doing it for himself. This comes down to how Thanos sees himself. This fucker believes that he is the one and only being that truly knows what's best for the universe and that everyone else is either misguided or wrong and he accepts the fact that he'll be hated for what he's doing and he's ok with it. He is willing to sacrifice everything he has, everyone he loves, and be hated by the universe because he KNOWS that what he's doing is right. He has accepted that he's the savior. That he'll be crucified and will do it regardless. He's heard what the trinity will say millions of times. His own daughter has tried to talk him out of him. He will never budge. it isn't as though there is no other way, there is, but Thanos is too close minded to see it. He lost his homeworld and that caused him to have this pathological desire to bring his personal vision down on the the rest of the universe regardless of who stands in his way. He will respect the three. He may even spare them I certainly doubt Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross wouldn't try and stop him but he will think they're weak hearted and wrong. He will hope that the earth remembers them and uses them as role models in the future but thats it."

    "output": "China Vs USA, Russia, and most of NATO, basically. At first everyone would be fighting border wars. Russia and China will fight a long conflict, but likely China has the resources to eliminate the potential threats presented by India, Pakistan and Japan fairly early and then would begin to push Russia back, who will have taken Finland, Norway and Sweden fairly early. USA stomp on Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina fairly quickly and push into Europe, joining up with U.K. and French forces who shouldn't have had much trouble cleaning up although they will take heavy losses in Germany but should win with the help of Italy eastern Europe and would likely be engaged in Africa or the Middle East or aiding Russia. When NATO in this case mostly USA, France, U.K. and Italy link up with Russian forces, its only a matter of time for China, although China will have a better chance if they manage to install Communist regimes in India, Japan and Pakistan and leverage their resources to wipe out as much of Russia's forces as possible before NATO forces link up with them difficult as Russia's landmass and army are both huge and they're not shy about using them. Whoever wins the Russia/China border war can clean up in Africa and South East Asia without too much trouble with their air forces. Meanwhile South Africa has been steadily advancing north and will eventually link up with NATO forces advancing south. I expect my home country of New Zealand will be stomped : TL;DR: Team blue wins, after 3-5 years. This assumes that no nukes are used and that all teammates get along."

    "output": "Assuming they both have identical physical and mental acuity and the only difference between them is what fruit they fire and their moms' names, then apple guy should win. An average medium apple weighs 182 grams, while an average medium orange only weighs 88 grams. We've established that both men fire their fruit at the same speed which means Appleman's apples will impact with significantly greater kinetic energy than Orangeman's oranges. 116 joules per apple vs 56 joules per orange. An apple a day keeps the doctor away, but three apples per second to the dome at 80 mph will bring the coroner. Source on- Apples being heavier than oranges Edited to add-According to this report every apple Appleman fires has a chance at being lethal if it hits Orangeman's head. Lethality probability starts at 20% lethality chance at 80 joules and ramps up 90% lethality chance at 150 joules. So Appleman, with his 116 joule appleblaster, will be throwing apples that have somewhere around a 30-40% chance of killing Orangeman in a single hit. Orangman's 56 joules have a 0% lethality chance meaning Orangeman WILL have to fight hand to hand at some point whereas Appleman can simply Spray and Pray."

    "output": "Trillionaire, no, billionaire with ease though. Let's say the average guy spends the prep day downloading all securities and sampling data from the past 20 years onto his phone. With modern phones that wouldn't be difficult to do, then he goes back in time and is off to the races. He starts via \"gambling\" to establish his bankroll, since he knows the outcome it's not really gambling so he can net a few million here easily. The issue is this quickly becomes impossible to replicate at scale, even with pre-knowledge of the outcomes. An underdog that pays 100-1 can become the favorite to win if you put enough money into that side of the bet, and so his ability to really turn a profit becomes mediocre at best compared to his total bankroll. This is the reason billionaires aren't made at the sports book. So he moves onto securities where his bankroll is pennies compared to total market volume. He starts plowing money into \"sure things\" this quickly sees his bankroll skyrocket, but then he realizes his trading data is no longer valid. Why? Because his volume is actively changing market analysis by other traders. Now by this point he is already a billionaire, but he is quickly reaching his ceiling. There is now no way he can effectively turn large returns quickly, and he can only make returns by slowly building up large positions quietly in firms he has future knowledge on being successful. Amazon, Tesla, Google, Apple, Nvidea etc etc. He has to remain diversified as hell because if his position in any of these firms becomes too large he will begin effecting the timeline in unforseen ways, possibly having the C suite teams make different decisions as the stock valuation has a floor based on our average guys massive position. Once he's achieved this he's one of if not the wealthiest men alive on paper, but there's an issue that keeps him from becoming a trillionaire. Liquidity. He can't feasibly exit these positions in a timely manner without tanking the value of the security, so his ability to move enough money around to make massive returns compared to his net worth is limited. Or to put it another way, the current world money supply is 93.3 trillion, that isn't nearly large enough to support one person having a liquid net worth of over a trillion. He could probably achieve it by 2035 though. Edit: for everyone pointing out that the prompt doesn't require the persons net worth to be liquid, that is correct. The reason I put that in there is because the biggest advantage this person has is foreknowledge on markets, meaning his best path towards wealth is securities. Securities are by their nature liquid, and the lions share of his net worth would be tied to these markets."

The 7 year olds can only attack once every 24 hour period. Each 24 hour period is 6am to 6am. Only one 7 year old can attack at a time. Only melee weapons a 7 year old could reasonably handle may be used by the 7 year olds. No ranged weapons or projectiles of any kind. Knives, daggers, small clubs, spears etc. The 7 year olds have not been trained for this but are given enough info to use their weapons decently for a 7 year old. The male has access to clean water, food, and shelter, but must venture outside to tend to crops and livestock at least twice a day if not more. The male also has access to a small workshop with limited supplies. He can fashion reasonable traps and weapons but supplies are hard to come by. He might be able to go scrap searching once a month to refurbish supplies in small quantites for such things. He has enough electricity to power an alarm clock and charge batteries for a dim crappy flashlight, otherwise his light comes from a kerosene lamp and stove at night. He lives isolated in a forest near the edge of an abandoned town. Edit: Update So far the consenus boils mostly down to two schools of thought. 1. 10 years is a LOT of time. One slip is all it takes, 7 year olds for sure And 2. 7 year olds are laughably non-threatingly, naive, and predictable, any self respecting adult with a mote of intelligencewould go big brain time and the 7 year olds wouldnt stand a damn chance.",
    "output": "The 7 year old team wins. One attack per day is insane. Eventually the adult is just going to get caught when he's asleep, farming, taking a shit, or somehow not expecting it. There's absolutely no way he can 100% 3,650 days in a row. One day a 7 year old will get lucky and cut, or even actually wound the adult. Will that cut get infected? How about the mental status of this adult male? How many children can you kill before it wears on you? How many years can you go constantly watching your back before you slip up? What if while bashing the face of 7 year old 500 in he throws out his back? Or trip and hurt his ankle? What about just a regular cold / flu? You're talking about someone who has to be on their A+ game basically 24 hours a day for ten straight years without fucking up even once. I don't think the adult male would ever win. There's just too many chances for the 7 year old to get the edge on him. Even with a 99.9% win rate he's still going to die by the third year on average."

    "output": "Unless the adult male really sucks, he's unlikely to ever have a problem. A simple baseball bat should suffice in a fight with any 7 year old, armed or not. After that, it's simply a matter of barricading himself in one of those abandoned buildings or the workshop at night so that the kids can't sneak up on him while he sleeps. Adult takes this low diff."

If its a small tenement bathroom the mirror likely gets broken when Kool-Aid shows up, even if it doesn't Kool-Aid is a bruiser likely to cause a decent amount of damage and in that small space the mirror gets broken easily. Beetlejuice is nearly untouchable by either of them. If Candyman knows how to get rid of him and says his name even once I see a plate being put over his mouth immediately. R2 its even worse because in the movie he was just playing around the whole time. in R1 kool aid in character just gives some juice and leaves. that's his goal, in R2 He has no method of attack that can touch BJ and the mirror getting broken is a definite thing For the record Mirror broken = candyman defeated Bonus round: Nobody wins - bloody mary doesn't give a fuck and murders the kid before anyone realizes what happened"

    "output": "Hmm, I'm the strongest person ever to live so I'll instead insert the average joe in this scenario. \"If you are between the ages of 18 and 40, and weigh around 198 pounds, you should be able to deadlift around 155 pounds even without training\" The implications in this are clear. Lifting 155 pounds will give them a 38.75 pound muscle increase. I'm assuming this is distributed equally to arms/legs, so that's only gonna be around 9 pounds of muscle each. That isn't even including the torso which would knock it down further. \"That sounds kind of weak,\" you say. Actually, the strength in this ability lies in it's revival... Say, I go to a graveyard. If I deadlift 155 there, I get an entire army of buffed dead people from across time to body my opponent. And I'm sure I'll get some animals too. Actually, depending on where I am, I can get some really strong animals to help me. Elephants, Rhinos, extinct but preserved animals like Sabertooth Tigers or a Mammoth, all of these are already ferociously strong. This ability is also enhanced further by the ability to deadlift anything. If I'm in a bad spot without having used my ability yet, I can lift a tissuebox, reviving a ton of dead, and then run away as far as possible so as to revive more people. With this ability, at a bare minimum, I could probably defeat any normal human no superpowers or special techniques and some street level characters that don't have insane mob clearing abilities or wild strength. If The Deadlifter is a toned ELITE LIFTER who can lift an amount close to 565 pounds, that's around 35.31 pounds in the arms and legs. With this buff, including any animals recieving this amount of growth 35 pounds possibly weighing more than their previous body weight altogether lmao I could potentially defeat a stronger street level character, and highballing this I could potentially beat somebody with Building level attacks by zerg rushing them and using tactical dead to surprise attack them."

Dead that is already lifted will gain more muscle and height if you deadlift again. However, this only works if the amount deadlifted is at least 25 pounds more than what is was upon the previous 'lift'. Better stretch bro! - Upon initial lifting, lifted dead are restored to 'living' condition eg they are not in a rotting, zombie-like condition. - Animals are 'lifted' too, but not insects. - Dead will remain lifted until killed again, or lifter dies. Dead lifted cannot be lifted again. - Dead being lifted must be moderately well preserved for lifting to occur",
    "output": ">The dead will gain 25% of what you lifted in muscle, as well as a 10% increase in their height prior to last lift. I'm having trouble parsing this out, so I'll lay out some assumptions: \"25% of what you lifted in muscle\" -> the dead gain muscle mass equivalent to 25% of what I dead lifted. \"10% increase in their height prior to last lift\" -> they grow by 10% of their living-height once lifted. These effects stack, but you can only add to the stack by pulling 25% more than your previous pull. The obvious strategy here is to go to the nearest big cemetery mine houses 200,000 former people and lift small, then build up. We'll say the people in the cemetery are 50/50 average men and women -- 100,000 men of 5'10\", 195 pounds, and 100,000 women of 5'4\" and 160 pounds numbers I got from googling. I will pull 45 pounds on my first rep, which will raise 200,000 undead soldiers from the earth and add 9 pounds of muscle to their frames. The men are now 6'6\"/205, the women are 5'10, 170. Rinse and repeat, adding 25% each time, until I hit my 1RM of 315 lbs: Weight Lifted | Men | Women :--|:--|:-- 57 lbs|7'2\"/219|6'5\"/184 70 lbs|94\"/236|84.7\"/202 87.5lbs|103\"/257|93\"/224 110lbs|113\"/284|102\"/251 137.5lbs|124\"/318|112\"/285.375 175lbs|136\"/361|123\"/328 220lbs|149\"/416|135\"/383 315lbs|164\"/494|148\"/461 So at the end, I have a huge army of 200,000 very skinny, very tall monsters, with the men being 13 feet tall and 500 pounds, and the women 12 feet tall and 460 pounds. That's a big number of scary people. I think I could take on the real world and win, given those powers and a good strategy -- especially if it's possible to kill and raise someone in a powerful position, like the leader of a world power which should be possible, I think, given the \"restored to living condition\" part."
