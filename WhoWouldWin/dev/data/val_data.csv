Who wins? Takes place in the game show. Neither knows what questions will be asked. They are the only contestants. Who will win the 1M?","The Wikipedia orb stomps. Wikipedia is more factual knowledge, and is good at providing sources and erasing bias. Reddit is more debate optimistically/ people screaming semi-coherent racial slurs at each other pessimistically. This means Snoo will get a huge amount of lies and nonsense from every possible side of every argument. The sheer volume of blatant falsehoods and a rating system based on popularity rather then truth means Snoo has no chance."
"argumenta sobre: All humans are shrunk down to be 6 inches tall. Can they remain the dominant species on the planet? Strength scales down accordingly. All buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure shrink down as well and remain accessible/functional on a miniaturized scale. Human-cultivated crops, domesticated animals, and anything inside a human-built building shrinks down as well. All wild plants and animals remain the same size. Does humanity survive? Does human civilization survive? Does humanity eventually succeed in controlling or eliminating the dangerous animals that would be a threat to them?","Most of the northern population probably dies because the infrastructure can't handle \1 feet of snow per night. Roads are blocked, land transportation is practically impossible, supplies are cut off. Regions that are prone to floods will probably get destroyed. People in villages with low industrialization are eaten. What about land speed? Wheels are times and times smaller so I guess vehicles now move slower, also? If so, we have some logistic issues..."

Wolfman proceeds to pounce at the couple to feed on them, only to witness someone swing a machete to hack the two of them to pieces while attempting to do so. The person responsible for these murders is none other than Crystal Lakes's most infamous resident, Jason Voorhees, who is currently on his mission to avenge the death of his beloved mother by killing anyone who enters the camp.

The Gauntlet includes all six canonical Marvel stones: Power, Time, Space, Mind, Soul, and Reality. We're taking the Chaos Gods at near-full warp power but not omnipotent.","Firstly there are 4 chaos gods technically more but definitely not 3. Secondly yes he can but probably not in the way you think. The gods are essentially just sentient embodiments of our deepest emotions and desires. So long as there are people to psychically feed the warp, they will always return in some way.

He has the blueprints to the Death Star. While making it would be too ambitious for us, we can study how to design faster than light spacecraft.

"argumenta sobre: Anakin skywalker vs Paul muad'ib atreides Who would win between these two in a single combat, each of them having their usual weapons, so lightsaber and blaster for Anakin, and krysknife and shield for Paul. Three scenarios: 1- the use of force and voice is authorized /2- use of force and voice is not authorized/3- they both only have the same weapon, a dagger, and no supernatural powers are authorized Edit: neither knows anything about the other's weapons Who do you think would win?","Movie paul loses all these fights, pretty badly. None of the movie versions of paul have gotten very deep into his story, or really discussed his powers. Basically it would be like looking at Anakin from Episode 1 and deciding that was as tough as he got. Book paul is a whole different animal. They aren't close and none of the others you see on screen are close. Movie Paul has enough precog that he ruled an empire over multiple galaxies after winning every fight using his precog... again over multiple galaxies, often when he had to give orders that would be carried out vastly later against people who knew he was a precog AND OTHER PRECOGS. IE: He can precog your precog and build out a plan that fully incorporates your fore knowledge of his plan into it so you still lose. Sardukar was the elite warriors of the emperor of the UNIVERSE, not galaxy. They were the best warriors possible. Book Sardaukar elite are capable of going toe to toe with the greatest swordsman from multiple galaxies and winning, and paul can no diff them. Paul fights using the Weirding Way, a FTE martial arts form that is fully integrated into the voice that allows him to move at FTE speeds while influencing people's minds using the voice. Advanced practitioners of this art are assumed to be able to teleport, this is incorrect, they just move that quickly. Kicking someone's head clean off is fully possible for an advanced practitioner. Note, Paul has a knife. Paul is not a force that can be beaten, he is an invincible god. HIs son is so invincible that he eventually creates a stain on the human soul so bad that they will never return to the life he forced upon them. S1: Paul happens onto Anakin when he's at his worst, that's literally the only time Paul would bother to meet him and there isn't a scenario where Anakin can force a meeting, pun intended. During the duel, Paul is never in a spot where Anakin feels using naked force attacks are the best, and Paul's command of the voice is so perfect that even if Anakin got lucky he could just tell him to stop. Anakin will not get lucky when Paul is nearby. Paul is faster and stronger than Anakin, period. Paul wins. R2: Paul wins harder, now he still has his precog and the Weirding way while Anakin has his sword. R3: Paul wins even harder, literally you gave him the weapon he's trained with his entire life and Anakin is used to fighting with a sword. Best case for Anakin, both of them die."
"argumenta sobre: Rational Man with a Shotgun runs a Looney Tunes gauntlet Bugs broke out of the animation cel and got hold of the animator's pen, and he decides to run Rational Man with a Shotgun RMWAS through some challenges. Bugs doesn't consider RMWAS an enemy, so he wants to play fair, and he sends him a telegram notifying him of what's coming.

RMWAS has unlimited ammo/shotguns and Looney Tunes dynamite and det cord. RMWAS is healed to full health after each round. RMWAS will face in any order - Porky Pig Sylvester Elmer Fudd Daffy Duck Wiley E. Coyote Yosemite Sam RMWAS selects the battlefield for each round, and can choose from - Woods where Elmer hunts and Bugs sometimes clashs with Daffy Farm where multiple characters occasionally feature Granny's House home of Tweety, but she won't participate The American West Roadrunner, Coyote City where multiple characters occasionally feature All battlefields are of indeterminate dimensions and are generally big enough for whatever the battle/cartoon needs. Combatants may temporarily retreat but can be located and pursued by their foe after 1 minute. Victory is by death, incapacitation, or capture If it's a stomp for the tunes, RMWAS gets mild toon force",I think neither being rational nor having a shotgun would be useful in a fight against any member of the Loony Tunes cast.

"argumenta sobre: Magnus Carlson vs an average man who can eat his chess pieces, but they are toxic. The average man has an elo of 1000 and an average body weight. He has the drug tolerance of an average heavy drinker and drug addict. Any time he eats one of Magnus's pieces, it counts as capturing it. Each of Magnus's pieces is dosed with 1 milligram of LSD per point value of the piece, each being made of the outside material used in standard medicine. The man fears no man demon or god and will eat any chesspieces he thinks is safe and wise to do with no hesitation. He is chesslusted. Magnus is a little scared for the man's saftey but he will not throw the chess game intentionally, nor make any intentional wrong moves. He is aware that the man can eat his pieces but not aware of the specific poisons in them, though he may suspect a little due to the fact that his chiece pieces look like a combination of chess pieces and pills. Magnus's king is dosed with as much cyanide as can fit in the chess piece. Average sized chess set. He is allowed to eat his own pieces if they cause him disadvantage, and they are regular pieces. EDIT: If he dies before he wins, he loses, and eating the king is not a win.","If the man is playing white, he starts by eating the black pawns on f7 and g7, and then the white pawn on e2. Then he moves the white queen to h5 for checkmate. If the man is playing black, Magnus likely opens with pawn to e4. The man eats the white pawns on f2 and g2, the black pawn on e7, and moves his queen to h4 for check. Magnus must move the king to e2, then the queen captures Magnus's pawn on e4 for checkmate. The man wins after ingesting at most 3mg of LSD, and tripping pretty hard."

"argumenta sobre: Palpatine must use his considerable manipulative skills to turn somebody to the LIGHT, while Yoda must turn somebody to the DARK. Who wins? Palpatine is arguably the most manipulative individual in the entire SW universe, but could he turn somebody to the ""light""? In contrast, could Yoda -- a beacon to the light and the Jedi -- turn somebody to the ""dark""? Success will decided by these particular factors: How long it takes to turn their respective targets If their respective targets STAY in the light/dark R1: No Force abilities allowed that would do things like cloud judgement. Giving up would count as losing. Yoda's target = Luke ESB; Palpatine's = Dooku ROTS R2: Yoda and Palpatine can 'give up' for ONE day; if they do not return to turning their respective targets, they lose. Friends/Family/Allies etc. of the targets will show worry and may be able to tell that something is amiss. Yoda's target = Luke ROTJ; Palpatine's = Vader ESB R3: Yoda and Palpatine are allowed to bring in one individual to help turn their respective targets. This helper must be on the same side as them, i.e. Sidious cannot choose Luke. Friends/Family/Allies etc. know that SOMEBODY is behind things but not who. Yoda's target = Obi-Wan ROTS; Palpatine's = Vader post-ROTS, but pre-ANH Bonus: Palpatine has to convert a version of HIMSELF TPM to the Light-Side, as does Yoda -- but to the Dark-Side. Who is most successful?","Palpatine wins in all cases. It's unclear whether he truly believes it, but he portrays himself as understanding and believing in the value of both the light and dark, and he evidently understands a pretty good amount about both. He's also much more personable and charismatic than Yoda. While Yoda understands the source of feelings of darkness, I don't think he can manipulate someone to it on a purely emotional level. I think sapient beings are inherently of the light, but are just quite corruptible. The thing is that while you can corrupt someone with money or other incentives fairly easily, doing so as just one person with only words is quite hard."

EDIT 14hrs later: since there's a suprising amount of debate in here I've decided to make a 2nd and 3rd round R2: Mii gunner, brawler, and sword fighter vs Wizard sim, vampire sim, and an alien sim R3: Matt vs Jim Pickens. Edit 1 day later: I might make a new post with more clearly defined rules so people wont be juggling so many things in terms of feats for each character.","What do each of them have on them? And do Sims expansions count? If Sims expansions count, they get a wand and the ability to Toadify from the start. Toad go squish. There's also other offensive spells they can learn, but Toadify is baseline just from starting the game with Makin' Magic installed. There are also several items and gadgets from the science profession in each base Sims game that can be lethal if Mii or the Sim are unlucky enough. Sims 3 also has a world traveling expansion where sims can train in martial arts, so I'm not so sure the arguments for Mii winning because they're masters of sports equals a 10/10 for Mii either."

"argumenta sobre: At what point would military technology make 'The Rumbling' from Attack on Titan ineffective. We see 19th-ish century technology kill a few but not enough. It's widely accepted that modern military would deal with the Rumbling relatively easily. Like, the obvious answer is 'the Nuke' because even a few could probably do the job. But would WWII levels of technology without the nuke be enough? Early cold war?",I think an important factor is preparation. In the Manga humanity was caught kind of off guard. If humanity has the time to prepare I'd say even WWI tech or WWII in case Eren decides to hide. Without preparation I'd say post cold war tech given that jets and armies in general are in some level of stand by all the time.

"argumenta sobre: Humanity gets 100 years of prep, who is strongest character they can take down? Round 1 Tomorrow, humanity will receive a name and detailed information about a powerful being set to attack in exactly 100 years, on November 5, 2124, at 12:00 CET. They will learn the being's strengths, weaknesses, and all the critical details needed for preparation. World leaders will choose the location of the attack, which must be a capital city with a population of at least 250,000. United under a single goal—to defeat this being at any cost—every person will dedicate their efforts to the mission. Though humanity continues to progress, resources are focused on survival, with all available funds channeled into research and technological upgrades, particularly in weapons and strategic defenses. Essential services remain intact, ensuring that no one is left without basic support. For the next century, humanity experiences an unprecedented era of peace. There are no wars, corruption, or harmful crimes, and all world leaders are committed to full cooperation, with countries like China ready to aid the United States and others without hesitation. Regardless of the number of casualties, a minimum of one million survivors must endure, ready to continue humanity's legacy. The strategic path to the being's defeat is up to humanity, but survival on a habitable world is non-negotiable. The countdown begins, and for the next century, humanity races to secure its future against an unstoppable adversary. Round 2 same as round one but Every human will also have their own strengths and weaknesses revealed at birth, allowing society to know each person's natural talents and limitations from the start. A child born with an aptitude for astrophysics, for example, will be encouraged to pursue it to the highest levels, while someone with a knack for engineering will be given the resources and training to excel. Natural disasters like earthquakes, tornadoes, and plagues cease entirely, giving humanity an ideal environment for preparation. Round 3 same as two previous rounds but Humanity a network that lets everyone instantly share what they know. Anytime someone learns something new or makes a breakthrough, that knowledge is instantly available to everyone else. It's like every person's skills, ideas, and discoveries flow across the world in real time. Imagine a scientist figuring out a new way to store energy; within seconds, engineers everywhere know exactly how to build it. If a combat expert comes up with a better tactic, every soldier understands it immediately. Instead of spending years training to learn skills others already have, people can just tap into the knowledge and use it right away.

How will this change the war's outcome? Can Germany resist allied forces beyond 1945 and conquer Moscow?,"Me-262s don't have laser designators so a Hellfire on one is just an expensive unguided rocket. You'd be better off firing them from the Blackhawks. 1000 Scuds allow them to hit Britain with the equivalent of a single daily B-17 raid, albeit with much worse accuracy. 250 F-15Cs are going to give them air superiority for a few days, and then they'll run out of ammo and spare parts.

"argumenta sobre: The US Military Runs a Burger King Guantlet It is said that one of the most terrifying capabilities of the United States military is its ability to deploy a fully functioning Burger King restaurant to any military front in 24 hours or less. But how far does this power actually go? In this challenge, The US military runs a logistics gauntlet where they need to deploy a Burger King restaurant to each of these locations within 24 hours. There's no prep time, the clock starts as soon as the military top brass learns of each location. The rules are simple: The Burger King needs to be able to serve any item on a standard Burger King menu It must be equipped to serve at least a dozen people It must do so without either running out of ingredients, being shut down, or being destroyed Round 1: Machu Picchu, Peru Round 2: The Middle of the Australian Outback Round 3: Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine Round 4: Point Nemo, Pacific Ocean Round 5: Anywhere on the Antarctic Ice Sheet Round 6: Anywhere on the Great Wall of China Round 7: The top of Krakatoa, Indonesia Round 8: Outside of the Kremlin, Moscow, Russia Round 9: The Summit of Mount Everest Round 10: Anywhere in Pyongyang, North Korea Bonus Round: The International Space Station How far do they get?","Summit of Mount Everest is not possible for lots of reasons. First, the weather there is a nightmare. You'd have to get super lucky with the timing to have a nice day. Even if the weather cooperates though, the bigger issue is that you can't fly to the peak. Exactly one person has managed it and it was with a modified lightweight custom rig. Hauling all the food and supplies up there would be an insurmountable challenge, and it takes too long to climb. Not to mention the altitude sickness. Even if we ignore all those issues, I'm pretty sure that physics gets in your way. It starts acting wacky that high up.

During his final confrontation with Near, Light Yagami is arrested without complications. Can he be convicted based on his actions alone, without the prosecution needing to reveal the existence of the Death Note or anything supernatural? Off the top of my head, there's stuff like ""obstruction of justice"" when he lead the task force and had them running around circles for years. But what else? Round 1: The trial takes place in Japan. Round 2: He is extradited to the USA, and the trial takes place there.

Not to mention Light could relinquish the Death Note at any time. Without the Death Note most evidence against light is circumstantial at best, no jury would convict a crime that's impossible without superpowers."

But those turn to disadvantages if the opponent can close the distance. Given no special training I'll give it to the Sledge 6 out of 10 - there will be a bit of intimidation factor and ease of use.

"argumenta sobre: Gimli Lord of the Rings vs the Mountain Game of thrones Morals off for both. Both start 20 meters apart. Both have all of their gear. Fight is won through the last man standing by either the death, incapacitation or BFR of all other opponents.","Gimli, and it's really not close. Despite the height difference, Gimli is likely stronger than Gregor. During the Twin Towers I think, Gimli falls. He has a warg land on him. He proceeds to lift it off him like a bench press and does so even after a second warg hops on. For reference, a warg is a horse-sized hyena \5 ft at the shoulder. Going by the weight of an average horse, that's 1,000-1,200 lbs per horse. Gimli, when pressed, can lift a ton from a lying position, and then keep fighting. The reach advantage would be crippling in standard HEMA, but Gimli is also the man who dove into a squad of orks and butchered them while having a casual conversation with Legolas. They competed to see who'd kill more, which iirc, Gimli won even though Legolas started shooting before Gimli got there. As for skill, Aragorn says he's never seen anyone wield an ax more skillfully while Gregor is repeatedly described as primarily reliant on brute strength to carry him through."

argumenta sobre: At what point in US history did we become capable of defeating a prime strength Mongol hoard? What year? Obviously the modern US military would stomp a bunch of horse riders. But also obviously the entire Mongol hoard would slaughter the first settlers on the Mayflower. Somewhere between them was a tipping point. The Mongols would try to conquer the entire colonies/ nation and would be invading from the south through Florida to avoid the Appalachians.,"1783 Mongols have nothing on Flintlock Rifles nor have they ever dealt with the US during a time when morale among the citizenry and army were at an all time high. You can use horde tactics all you want, won't change the fact that you have an army taking pot shots at your horses from well beyond the range of your bows. Even if the Mongols got a hold of some flintlocks of their own they have neither the manufacturing capability to make more nor the expertise to use them effectively. They also have proper cannons by this time which are an impossible technological hurdle to get over. Finally, random partisans across the East Coast who are used to subsistence living are going to jump at the chance to steal some very expensive horses from the Mongols.

"argumenta sobre: George Lucas gets immortality, a sledgehammer, and magical knowledge of the current location of every copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special. Ignoring the internet, can George destroy them all? More specifically, every internet copy is deleted and the internet can no longer be used to transmit the program. Copies must be made using physical, non-internet means. If a physical copy is moved, Lucas knows. George will do what he must. Or, at least, he will try.","Someone in slightly below average physical condition could reasonably smash around 20 videotapes per minute. George Lucas has a net worth of $6 billion, so he could easily afford a private jet. It's hard to say how many physical copies of the Holiday Special currently exists. The vast majority of the videotapes are made by Star Wars fans in the 70s and 80s, so I think a reasonable figure would be around 100,000 to 500,000 copies. Lucas could theoretically destroy all copies within a few months, assuming he has no problems with breaking into Star Wars geeks' place of residence. I don't think the police will be much of a problem, Lucas can easily afford to bribe every officer he comes across. However, this is assuming that no new copies are being made. If some Star Wars fan is Special-lusted, they simply have to produce the videotapes at a rate faster than 20 copies per minute, and Lucas will never be able to destroy them all. Of course, if he does not have to personally oversee the destruction of every copy of the special, then it's trivially easy for Lucas to win. With his immense fortune, he could simply hire hundreds of hitmen to hunt down and destroy every copy."
"argumenta sobre: Average ogre from Warcraft vs zergling from Starcraft. Who would win? The ogre has its classic weapons and armor, not elite. He's a normal warrior, not a wizard. The zergling is also a classic zergling, nothing special. At first I was thinking about an ultralisk instead of a zergling, but I think it would be too much for the ogre unless maybe it's a wizard one.","Zergling should take it. The average ogre is a moron, his classic armor is a loin cloth and his classic weapon is a wooden club. Strength wise the ogre eclipses an orc we've seen orcs lift horses over head and throw them through jungle trees, and ogre hide is occasionally shown to be as effective as real armor. The Zergling has a carapace that can shake off a hypersonic round at a glancing hit, can fight while missing its fucking head, can tear through neo-steel, and can keep up with Protoss Zealots in combat who are capable of dancing around hypersonic rounds for some fractions of a second when going all out and comparable in travel speed to futuristic skirmish vehicles. The Zergling can also vibrate its body fast enough to burrow through packed earth and can regenerate to peak shape given time. Even if we go with an Ogre above average, lets say a warlord who's generally larger, more powerful, wearing plate armor and wielding weapons made of fantastical metal, and able to strike the ground hard enough to weaponize the shockwaves. He's got no counter to burrowing, while being out-sped and having less immediately deadly attacks."

Elsewhere, the scripture of the sauce states: >Soybean Oil, Sweet Relish diced Pickles, Sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Distilled Vinegar, Salt, Corn Syrup, Xanthan Gum, Calcium Chloride, Spice Extractives, Water, Egg Yolks, Distilled Vinegar, Spices, Onion Powder, Salt, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Garlic Powder, Vegetable Protein hydrolyzed Corn, Soy And Wheat, Sugar, Caramel Color, Turmeric, Extractives Of Paprika, Soy Lecithin. Rome already has trade routes to India for the turmeric. There are natural petroleum seeps in Greece and probably other places they've conquered for propylene glycol. Roman metallurgy might not handle the pressures involved in an oil refinery, but you can attach some stuff about Bessemer process steel to the Book of Big Mac. Xanthan gum is not a plant or a petroleum product. It's actual magic and likely a gift from the gods. It is said to have come from bacteria found on a diseased plant found by the Department of Agriculture in Illinois in the 1950s and that's where the trail goes ice cold. Which is how you get to alt history of McRomans in steel conquering what will eventually be America to find diseased plants to complete the sacred sauce."
"argumenta sobre: A very strong 150 lb fighter, vs a very strong 300 lb regular athlete A 150 lb fighter and a 300 lb athlete get into a fight. Both are very strong relative to their size, and both are made of muscle, with not much body fat. Athlete is untrained. Fighters stats: Bench 180, Squat 375, Deadlift 450 Athletes Stats: Bench 360, Squat 750, Deadlift 900 R1: Competition rules. No low blows or dirty strikes groin shots, eye pokes, knee stomps, etc MMA rules. R2: Street fight. Dirty techniques such as the latter is allowed. Anything goes as long as it's unarmed and 1v1. R3: Athlete has experience street fighting. No formal training, just bar fights, for example. Bonus Round: Athlete has 3 months of basic training. A little fighting experience. If the fighter dominates all rounds, how would it go with different levels of experience? How would a 1 year fair? 2-4 year amateur? 5+ year pro fighter?","As someone with a competitive jiu jitsu background and once trained at an MMA gym only took a few classes, I was there for the jits lol: The larger guy definitely in this situation. Rener Gracie had a YouTube video where he asked if your average sized jiu jitsu practitioner with a purple belt could ""survive"" not win a 30 second elevator fight with an NFL lineman and the answer was ""doubtful"" with the average male being say 5'10 and weighing in at 170ish. This hypothetical situation gives us an MMA pro but at 150 this is a smaller guy taking on a behemoth athletic man. Have I personally witnessed blue belts and up easily rolling up 200 plus pound lower belts on the mats? Regularly. I am not a heavy guy but definitely submitted a lot of 200 plus pounders. However, none of these guys were ex collegiate athletes, these were just out of shape big guys who didn't know jiu jitsu where you cannot slam or strike. Only way our MMA Lightweight-Featherweight wins this is with MMA rules and he uses his striking to soften up our big guy and then finish him with a submission. At 150 going up against an absolute unit of a man, he won't be able to KO the big guy. I can also speak from experience that a skilled jiu jitsu grappler at 150 will struggle heavily with an athletic, muscular 300 pound guy with no grappling experience but played say rugby or college football."

Which would cause the most trouble? The Jokers are dropped in different major cities all over the USA. They are the same as in their movie/show incarnations, but without the connections. Anything they could build or plan in their worlds, they can accomplish similar feats in ours, if it's not physically impossible, like Caesar Romero Joker doesn't get the human dehydrating machine from the Batman movie he was in. Which Joker causes the most problems? The least? How would you rank these six psychopaths in terms of what they'd be able to accomplish in the real world?","From least to most trouble: Phoenix: This Joker is just an angry guy with mental health issues. Might commit some random crimes, but will end up in prison or a mental health instution pretty soon, if he is not shot outright due to resisting arrest. Has no connections, no special skills, no wealth, no leadership qualities etc. Romero Joker: The show is mostly comedic, but this Joker is more stable and more capable of planning. Still, not a real threat. Can easily be defeated even by elderly houseservants. Jared Leto: This Joker is not only violent, but capable of running a criminal empire. Also pretty good at manipulating people. Finally, while he is heavily tatooed and has green hair, he would not look as out of place as some other Jokers in modern settings. His downside is his lack of mental stability, which causes him to act very irrational at times, like picking fights with random strangers in a bar. Nicholson/Ledger: Tied for first place. Both are utterly ruthless and have no qualms about killing when it suits their plans. Both are capable of executing highly complex plans like Bank heists and have significant leadership capabilities, as both have no problem recruiting henchman who are willing to kill and die for them. Both are not so mentally unstable that it hurts their plans. never seen Monaghan, so I can not comment on this"

Captain America: The captain and leader of America. Otherwise known as Donald Trump, currently. He has the access to the Secret Service won't have access to the entire army or nukes, to keep things balanced, and is trained in both basic hand to hand and small firearms usage.

Doctor Strange: A regular man. He acts kind of weird and has a PhD in medicine. Black Panther: A black panther. What else? Ant-Man: A man who is similar to an ant. He has six legs, antennae, and can lift up to 10 times his weight. Captain Marvel: The leader of Marvel Comics - Stan Lee, naturally. Assume he's still alive. War Machine: A machine who has several guns. Quicksilver: A man who is spray painted Silver and can run up to 25 MPH. Vision: A man who has exceptionally good eyesight. Scarlet Witch: A red witch. She can ride a broom and can brew potions. Falcon: A falcon. Spider-Man: A man with 8 eyes, 6 arms and 2 legs. He can shoot webs out of his ass, too. It's a Battle Royale. No alliances.

Assuming Scarlet Witch has potions that can be used offensively she has a pretty good chance of taking out the more durable people like Iron Man and Hulk. Flying also helps her, but she could get gunned down quite easily. War Machine has a good chance soley because of his guns. Ant Man can lift heavy things so he could chuck boulders and stuff at people. Trump with a couple of heavily trained guardsmen probably has a good chance winning if they communicate effectively and don't panic."
"argumenta sobre: Humanity gets 100 years of prep, who is strongest character they can take down? Round 1 Tomorrow, humanity will receive a name and detailed information about a powerful being set to attack in exactly 100 years, on November 5, 2124, at 12:00 CET. They will learn the being's strengths, weaknesses, and all the critical details needed for preparation. World leaders will choose the location of the attack, which must be a capital city with a population of at least 250,000. United under a single goal—to defeat this being at any cost—every person will dedicate their efforts to the mission. Though humanity continues to progress, resources are focused on survival, with all available funds channeled into research and technological upgrades, particularly in weapons and strategic defenses. Essential services remain intact, ensuring that no one is left without basic support. For the next century, humanity experiences an unprecedented era of peace. There are no wars, corruption, or harmful crimes, and all world leaders are committed to full cooperation, with countries like China ready to aid the United States and others without hesitation. Regardless of the number of casualties, a minimum of one million survivors must endure, ready to continue humanity's legacy. The strategic path to the being's defeat is up to humanity, but survival on a habitable world is non-negotiable. The countdown begins, and for the next century, humanity races to secure its future against an unstoppable adversary. Round 2 same as round one but Every human will also have their own strengths and weaknesses revealed at birth, allowing society to know each person's natural talents and limitations from the start. A child born with an aptitude for astrophysics, for example, will be encouraged to pursue it to the highest levels, while someone with a knack for engineering will be given the resources and training to excel. Natural disasters like earthquakes, tornadoes, and plagues cease entirely, giving humanity an ideal environment for preparation. Round 3 same as two previous rounds but Humanity a network that lets everyone instantly share what they know. Anytime someone learns something new or makes a breakthrough, that knowledge is instantly available to everyone else. It's like every person's skills, ideas, and discoveries flow across the world in real time. Imagine a scientist figuring out a new way to store energy; within seconds, engineers everywhere know exactly how to build it. If a combat expert comes up with a better tactic, every soldier understands it immediately. Instead of spending years training to learn skills others already have, people can just tap into the knowledge and use it right away.

Mix in a lot of dependencies and connections and if statements and you have the perfect trap for our bald enemy. It needs to be as convoluted as possible. Humanity also adapted the same currency as from Saitama's world so he can use his money to go to the grocery-store. He is also provided with a free room to stay. All coupons are with no time-limit attached to it. If he ever comes up with the perfect solution to do the perfect, reduced buy, at least one of the products is out of stock or is not longer getting produced so he needs to repeat the process he is always given more coupons to make it even harder.

Let's compare 1:1. -maurders are worse than terminators in every way except they have a shell factory in their suit. -reapers are OoM worse than assault marines and are even lacking armor on their ass lol. -Ghosts if you're counting them are worse than psykers but better infiltrators than stealth oriented marines, they have the edge here. The average ghost isn't touching the average librarian, I don't think multiple of them makes any difference, only the extreme high end ghosts are really strong Nova and Kerrigan, who would still struggle a 1v1 as Nova anyway. R3 should still be a very solid 40k victory. Siege tanks, Goliaths, vikings, thors and medvaks get destroyed by predator tanks, land raiders, thunderhawks, sky furies, dreadnoughts, etc. BCs are good on paper but their durability showings are legitimately made of paper, they're effortless to actually damage heavy damage by mutas in a cutscene, a siege tank in lore, and spore crawlers in a comic.

Dooku can just run away and maul could do nothing about it. Dooku can't really kick maul to death either though, since Maul assumedly still has his sabers. So, yeah. Most likely Dooku wins.

"argumenta sobre: Mike Tyson with a few buffs tries to knock out the human race We talking prime Iron Mike Tyson, here. &x200B; For the sake of this prompt, Mike gets ""a few"" buffs. &x200B; 1. Mike is able to materialise and dematerialise boxing gloves and wraps on his hands, therefore he can punch with full force and yet be able to have free use of his hands whenever he needs to. 2. Whenever Mike knocks somebody out or kills them, his body is restored to its perfect physical condition that it was in, in the beginning of this prompt. Through this, Mike foregoes all need for food, sleep, and can heal all injuries, provided he knocks somebody out. 3. A ""knocked out"" individual is transported to an alternate dimension where all of Mike Tyson's knockout victims reside, to await the end of this WWW prompt. 4. Mike is protected by a force field that only allows human hands to make contact with his skin. Anything else, from headbutts, to kicks, to knives, blunt weapons, guns and even goddamn nuclear explosions will not hurt Iron Mike. ONLY hands. The kinetic force of any weapon other than human hands will not even move Tyson a centimetre. 5. An indestructible, immortal, and otherwise untouchable assistant will be available to Mike Tyson, whose only function is to transport Mike Tyson to wherever he wants to go. Said assistant is able to conjure whatever vehicle Mike Tyson desires, and is even able to teleport Mike Tyson if Mike is trapped in a situation. Mike cannot be teleported in the middle of hand to hand combat, or use teleportation for the purposes of gaining combat advantage. Mike is telepathically connected to his assistant. 6. Mike can innately sense the location and distance of people nearby, making it impossible to hide one's location from him. Edit: This last ability has no range limit, if Mike knocks out say everybody on the continent he's on, he'd be able to detect the nearest person, even if they're an ocean away. &x200B; With all that said, can Mike Tyson successfully knock out/kill the human race? How long would it take him to do so? What is the human race's best chance at stopping Iron Mike Tyson? &x200B; Edit: Mike Tyson starts this prompt in the present day, at your current location. RIP you.",I think there could be a loophole here. A good MMA fighter may be able to grapple Mike down with his hands and then beat the shit out of him from a mount.

These the will be the Marvel Animated Universe'97 & the DC Animated UniverseTimmverse versions. All connected content as well. Ok so the Mutant Registration laws are spilling into riots in the streets, things are getting out of hand. In this universe the Marvel & DC Universes have a coexisting history and world. So to be plain, they know who each other are. With that said the Justice League decide the best way to keep the peace is to bring the X-Men in to calm everything down. The X-Men aren't having this and decide to counter and hit one of the Justice League members first on his home turf... Batman. Only the League sees this coming a mile away wait for them in downtown Gotham. The X-Men land in the Blackbird & the League land the Javelin. Morals on. Fight begins.This varys based on which round but, same idea This is a no exception situation. Justice League have to bring the X-Men in or be branded enemies of the state as well. Win by K.O. or Death. 3 Rounds. Who wins? = Team Leader Round 1: 9v7 X-Men - Cyclops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, The Beast, Gambit, Jubilee, Jean Grey & Professor X Justice League - Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Superman, Martian Manhunter, The Flash & Hawkgirl Round 2: 11v7 X-Men - Magneto, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Wolverine, Morph, Rogue, The Beast, Gambit, Jubilee, Bishop Justice League - Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, The Flash & Hawkgirl Round 3: 17v17 X-Men - Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Morph, Rogue, The Beast, Jubilee, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Colossus, Sunspot, Bishop, Cable, Forge, Psylocke & Spider-Man is joining the X-Men as a bonus.

Three of the X-Men lost to the Temù version of Superman in TAS Gladiator. The X-Men don't have invulnerability except for Rogue and Colosus. MM vs Jean Is interesting but the rest would lose.

"argumenta sobre: Alexander the great is given immortality, could he conquer the known world? Alexander cannot die of old age but can be killed through battle","If he's immortal, but can still be killed, I don't see this helping too much. Eventually he's going to fall down a flight of stairs, drink poison, get assassinated, or just get pulled out to sea by a riptide and drown. I'd give him maximum of 200 years of extra life before just dying due to normal bad luck of stuff that would kill people within 3-5 extra human lifetimes."
"argumenta sobre: The UNSC-Covenant War, but the UNSC gets a 10x numerical modifier to all assets The human/covenant war begins as normal. The Great Schism will not happen in this alternate universe. It will simply be a battle to the finish. All UNSC numerical assets are multiplied by 10. This includes: Colonies, population, number of ships, weapons, etc. This is ONLY a quantitative modifier and not a qulitative one.","The win condition for UNSC has always been reverse engineering the superior technology of the covenant and making it their own. Spartan personal shields are reverse engineered and improved versions of elite shields for Instance. Given ten times the population , planets and personnel to throw into the meat grinder while ONI comes up with solutions I think the UNSC has a 4/10 to force a stalemate on key worlds. I think the tech gap and zealotry of the covenant without the great schism makes victory out of reach though."
"argumenta sobre: The arguably most incompetent general in modern human history Lt. Gen. Mutaguchi Renya leads an army of the most incompetent soldier in recorded history ISIS fighter Abu Hajaar. Assuming following conditions, what army, fictional or nonfictional, LOSES to them? Background Inside For purposes of brevity, we will refer to the army of Abu Hajaars + Gen. Renya as the Dream Team. Background: Our incompetent commander: Lieutenant General Mutaguchi Renya of the Imperial Japanese Army. Despite his high position within the Imperial Japanese Army, General Renya had no idea how to mount a campaign, no less organize logistics or create a coherent strategy. This can be best seen in the debacle that was the Battle of Imphal, in which the Japanese attempted to invade India, but was beaten back into the Jungles of Burma and slowly starved over the course of 4 months. Due to poor planning by Gen. Renya, 55k troops out of 90k died during the campaign, mostly from sickness and starvation. Historians argue that the disastrous loss of life and eventual retreat without gaining anything of substance hastened Japan's defeat at the hands of the allies. Due to his actions, Lt. Gen Renya was reviled as one of the 'Three Filths' 三大汚物 of the Japanese Army. From Wikipedia: > The Japanese defeat at Kohima and Imphal was the largest up until that time,2 with many of the Japanese deaths resulting from starvation, disease and exhaustion suffered during their retreat. Just to give you guys an idea of how incompetent he was, here are some quotes by our commander: In which he explains his so-called Genghis-Khan tactic of transporting supply through the Jungle: > Instead of motorized vehicles, we can transport supplies on cows or horses, and when those supplies are spent, we can eat the animals. Anyone who was raised in a farm knows this is a bad idea since domesticated beasts of burden require hay or other prepared foods to meet their immense caloric requirements. Should this be unavailable, the herbivores need to graze for hours on end since just raw plant matter isn't dense in calories. Furthermore, Jungles are host to thousands of species of plants, many of which are poisonous. When this plan inevitably failed, it fell to the soldiers to carry the supplies - contributing to exhaustion and loss of morale. In which he reprimands a commander for retreating when his men literally ran out of food: > 諸君、佐藤烈兵団長は、軍命に背きコヒマ方面の戦線を放棄した。食う物がないから戦争は出来んと言って勝手に退りよった。これが皇軍か。皇軍は食う物がなくても戦いをしなければならないのだ。兵器がない、やれ弾丸がない、食う物がないなどは戦いを放棄する理由にならぬ。弾丸がなかったら銃剣があるじゃないか。銃剣がなくなれば、腕でいくんじゃ。腕もなくなったら足で蹴れ。足もやられたら口で噛みついて行け。日本男子には大和魂があるということを忘れちゃいかん。日本は神州である。神々が守って下さる... > Commander Sato abandoned the Kohima front of the battle against issued orders. He did so with the excuse that his men ran out of food. You call this the Imperial Army? The Imperial Army must fight when they have no food. not having weapons, ammunition, or food are not an excuse to give up fighting. You have bayonets if you have no bullets. Use your fists if you have no bayonets. If your fists are unusable, kick them with your feet. If your feet are unusable, bite them with your teeth. Japanese men have the Yamato Spirit, do not forget. Japan is the nation of Gods, Gods will protect us..."" In which he answers the complaints of the advance platoons that they have nothing to eat: > 日本人はもともと草食動物なのである。これだけ青い山を周囲に抱えながら、食料に困るなどというのは、ありえないことだ > Japanese people are originally herbivores. When we are surrounded by the verdant jungle, it is impossible for us to low run on food. Honestly this guy is a gold mine for stupid quotes, but this post is already getting too long. Our Incompetent Soldier: ISIS Fighter Abu Hajaar This Video shows you everything that you need to know, but it can be summed up in this one quote: ""What is wrong with you, Abu Hajaar?"" Video Summary of his incompetent feats: Pelts his friend who was preparing an anti-vehicle rocket launcher with hot bullet casings from his machine gun Doesn't set up his MG3 Machine Gun properly, causing himself to be knocked backwards by the recoil and peppers the interior of the vehicle with bullets, nearly killing his allies Stands on ammunition so that his mates can't get to them Roasts his friends from backdraft from an RPG Can't tell the difference between anti-personal vs anti-vehicle rockets Doesn't take off safety cap off of his rockets prior to firing THROWS HOMEMADE GRENADE TO THE FLOOR IN FRUSTRATION WHEN IT DOESN'T FIT rolls around in the open with no cover, thinking it will protect him when he is forced to exit the vehicle. The Rules of the Battle: Remember, the goal is to pick a commander and an army fictional or nonfictional that is so dysfunctional, it will lose against the dream team. The army that goes against our dream team should be composed of at least 1 commander. The Dream Team will adjust its number of men i.e. Abu Hajaars to match that of the opposing army. The Dream Team is armed with armaments and vehicles that can be seen in the video. They also gain access to equipement and vehicles that the Japanese Imperial Army would have had in the year 1944. For balance, the challengers should at least be on similar level of weapons technology as the Dream Team, or should have hax that will let them fight vs the Dream Team on even footing. However, if the challengers are so incompetent that they will lose vs the dream team even with more advanced technology, that is allowed. You may mix and match the challenging commanders and army. You can take a commander out of the appropriate time period to command the opposing army example: if you want to use a really incompetent 13th century army general from France, you may use him to command an army with appropriate tech level. In such a case, assume that the commander is familiar with modern technology. The commanders of both sides are responsible for organizing logistics/communication/strategy and making sure the men in their command carries out their orders. The battle conditions are as follows: Both sides must capture and hold a jungle island that is separated by 1000 km of ocean from their home nation/main base. The island is a perfect circle with a diameter of 100km with gentle sloping beachheads, But rises up to a single mountain, 1000m above sea level in the center. The mountain slopes are gentle. The jungle starts 500m away from the shore, and quickly thickens. There are some sources of fresh water on the island. An array of 20 freshwater springs are present on the island. Each spring can supply up to 500 men per day, and they are located 50km away from the center of the island in a way that they form an evenly spaced circle. Suppose that both sides have landed at the exact same time on opposite sides of the island. Bonus: What is the most technologically primitive army that can beat the dream team?","There are almost infinitely many fictional commanders and soldiers who will easily lose to your dream team. After all, Lt. Gen. Renya, as incompetent as he is, has been educated in a military academy and has had actual experience commanding troops. He would probably be slightly better of a commander than your average Hoi4 player. As for Hajaar, he might be a hotheaded idiot, but at the end of the day he is still an able-bodied, reasonably healthy adult willing to die - and kill - for a completely delusional cause. He would probably be a better soldier than an average 15 year old. Whereas in fiction, the commanders and soldiers can be as stupid, cowardly, and weak as you want. My team would be Lt. Gen Scheisskopf Catch-22 commanding an army of Jojo Rabbit. Scheisskopf will be too focused on drilling to do anything else, while Jojo will do anything to avoid killing people. They would easily be massacred by the Hajaars in a single day, before logistics becomes too much of a problem for Renya. Bonus round: Any uncontacted tribe in the Amazon. Discovery of fire may not be necessary."

"argumenta sobre: A Human Hivemind has 1000 years to get ready to survive in Warhammer 40k. Today's world suddenly becomes a semi-hivemind with all the knowledge and wisdom that humanity has collectively. All humans will be able to act as individuals, but everyone will have a single goal in mind above all, and all will possess the entirety of human knowledge updated real-time in their heads. Any individual can speak telepathically to any other, instantly, disregarding distance. The hivemind knows its goal: make the solar system a fortress, for in a thousand years, it will be thrust into a different dimension 40k, a hundred light years from the original Holy Terra. Does the Hivemanity have a chance of becoming a major player on the galactic scale? How would it play out? Let's assume the tech HVM develop will be what tech can be predicted to exist in our universe near light speed missiles to rid planets of life, dyson swarms, spacetime bubble FTL, etc. - all the stuff that has been a seriously regarded theory at least at one point in time., and when it crosses over, it will have the capability to learn warp travel and other technologies the factions of 40k possess. Note: THIS IS NOT A VS MATCH. DO NOT SAY THAT NECRONS CRUSH OR TYRANIDS STOMP. IT IS A SCENARIO. YES, THE FULL MIGHT OF THE NIDS WOULD STOMP THE T'AU, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE. IT IS NOT A DEATH MATCH.","In 1000 years, maybe we could come up with some crazy tech. Maybe we could out tech the imperium and tau. In 1000 years what we can't do is have the numbers to matter. The human population is growing at around .87% a year. Could hive mind humanity increase that? Probably. Could it increase that significantly? Probably not. We are still limited by resources. We can expand through our solar system, but realistically any major agriculture would be on earth, and MAYBE Mars. So 1000 years from now we theoretically might have 46 trillion people ignoring the lack of resources to support that, a hive world is usually 50 billion to 2 trillion people. Confined to one solar system. That might work to prevent us all dying to a passing imperial patrol, or a tau sphere of expansion. But if orks land, that's going to snowball into a major problem. If tyranids get there, that's just more biomass for them to consume. Humanities best bet is to pop out in the 40k verse, and immediately signal the imperium that their long lost cousins have arrived, and have prepared many well equipped guard regiments with long lost technology to assist them."

The key here is since your brother has to fight close up where his punch through steel strength and bojutsu can come unto play he has to get around Aang's fireballs, ice shards, rocks, and wind blasts. The key to that is the flight and the peregrine falcon speed. I'm going to take that to mean he can fly as fast as a peregrine falcon can dive which is a mean 240mph! Aang hasn't fought anything that fast, so getting up that close should be feasible. I'm going to give your brother the slight edge here.

Reddit and many subs are joining Google Facebook Twitter and several others to talk about what losing Net Neutrality would be like. So we're posting a banner to be a part of it, because paying a premium rate to Comcast so we can discuss what would happen if the Roman Empire fought the armies of Mordor would be awful. The website battlefortheinternet.com has a pre-written letter you can send to the FCC. You can also contact your representative and tell them to protect net neutrality.

"argumenta sobre: All humans are shrunk down to be 6 inches tall. Can they remain the dominant species on the planet? Strength scales down accordingly. All buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure shrink down as well and remain accessible/functional on a miniaturized scale. Human-cultivated crops, domesticated animals, and anything inside a human-built building shrinks down as well. All wild plants and animals remain the same size. Does humanity survive? Does human civilization survive? Does humanity eventually succeed in controlling or eliminating the dangerous animals that would be a threat to them?","Disclaimer: I know nothing about square cube law or how it would realistically work, I'm only aware of its depiction/application in fiction. Anyway with that out of the way, there's a few ways to look at it First militarily. Your average human shrunken down to six inches would be superhuman in terms of strength and speed to anything else not shrunken down. Making a physically fit human an instant supersoldier level threat to larger creatures. However our conventional weapons such as bullets would become incredibly ineffective against larger creatures. Missiles and other large projectiles might still be effective bit unless we want humanity to equip every human with a rocket launcher it's a pretty unhelpful thing. In terms of agriculture we might survive and even thrive especially since farm animals have also been shrunken down to match our new height meaning we would still have a regular supply of food and if necessary hurting down at least ten regular size cattle could sustainably feed your average city for a few days. Meaning the problem of global hunger just got solved. In terms of climate, there's a good and bad. Good being that the earth can replenish itself without as hindering her too much. The bad being that at pur size regular showers become monsoon level rains and snow storms bring about an ice age. In all humanity could survive. Many people would die and we may no longer have complete dominant of the earth like we once did, but we would still be credible contender for dominant species"

Rd 3: Same as Bonus Rd 1, but this time Mike has knowledge that Dexter is after him. Who's winning each round?","Walt 10/10. His intellect is well above Dexter's and he has far more resources in the criminal underworld. He comes up with very intricate plans and unexpected solutions to problems that work more often than they ought to because as Jesse puts it, ""Mr. White, he's the devil. He is smarter than you, he is luckier than you."" Dexter's only chance at killing him would be trying to prove Walt's guilt to the police and hoping that he dies by resisting arrest, but if he's safely taken into custody, Dexter has no chance of killing him. Dexter would have a much better shot if Walt wasn't aware of him, though. BR1: I think Dexter 7/10. Mike has good awareness and instincts, is generally cautious, and can certainly handle himself in a fight. He wouldn't be an easy target. If he catches wind of Dexter's intentions at any point, he isn't getting taken down. However, if Dexter is aware of this and approaches him with an effective plan, Mike won't really have a way out. BR2: If Mike is by himself, Mike 9/10. He specializes in finding people and has been up against much worse odds and faced people more dangerous than Dexter on many occasions. If this is occurring while Mike still has the resources and connections of Walt, Jesse, Saul etc. then Mike 10/10."

"argumenta sobre: A Napoleonic Wars ranker vs a medieval archer, who wins? The Napoleonic Wars ranker is armed with a Charleville 1777 musket with a bayonet attached to it and an ammo pouch containing 40 cartirages. The Medieval archer is armed with a longbow, a dagger, and a buckler. The archer also has a quiver containing 36 arrows and is wearing a helmet and chainmail armor. Both are experienced in using their respective weapons. Battle takes place in an open field. Both combatants start 100 feet away from each other. Bonus: Both start 30 feet away from each other with no ammo and have to fight in melee combat, who wins?","The weight of the evidence suggests that even matchlock firearms in the second half of the 16th century & perhaps earlier were more accurate than warbows. Across the world from each other, Qi Jiguang & Humphrey Barwick each made this claim. Joe Gibbs struggled to hit a human-sized target at 50m 164ft. An 18th-century soldier who's a decent shot should hit the torso reliably at that distance. I suspect the ranker wins because of greater accuracy & stopping power. There's a chance they end up in close combat in the first scenario because 100ft isn't very far. Once in close combat, the ranker should have the advantage because the archer curiously doesn't have a sword. It'd take a pretty heavy mail to stop a thrust from a bayonet, at least if it's triangular as many were. With a sword, I'd probably give close combat to the archer. Buckler & dagger could work, but I don't think it's great against a bayonet."
"argumenta sobre: Tony Stark crashes onto Tatooine, his armor destroyed, and in the middle of the Desert, how long until he takes down the Empire? Lets say after Avengers 1, instead of falling back to Earth in the portal, he lands in a Desert, Tatooine. His armor breaks his fall, but is not functional as a result. He's not too far from civilization. Lets say it's a year after the Empire has risen What does he do? How long until he takes down the Empire? Assume he knows nothing about the universe he inhabits, and has to learn their science from scratch. Round 1: MCU Tony Stark Armor non functional Round 2: 616 Tony, armor non functional Round 3: Same scenario, destroyed armor, but with 616 Victor Von Doom Winning conditions: Kill/Stop/Neutralize the Emperor","I don't think there's a definite answer as to when Tony pulls it off, but the probability curve becomes significantly greater the longer he has to learn and tinker. Tony Stark in any iteration is an exponential challenger, it's just a matter of how well he can stay out of his own way. Given enough time, he'd have a light frigate that can outpunch destroyer-class ships and outmaneuver ARC-170's if not TIEs - my money personally is on ablative warheads with seismic charge payloads jammed into them and disruptor cannons, and if an arc reactor can power as much of Manhattan as his does, it can feed a starship. I'd fully expect a beskar or cortosis War Machine suit with a personal deflector shield, probably with disruptor, ion, slug, and repulsor options for offense. I say time rather than resources because the man speaks two specific languages: commerce and salvage. Get him off Tatooine, and it's not a question of if he succeeds, it's just a matter of how long it takes him to become unassailable. Now why he wants to take out the Emperor is another question. Sure, Palpatine is deeply skeevy, but if Tony displays any of this savvy, he's getting the Chief of Research position at the Maw Installation and a commensurate salary offered to him. With no prior knowledge of the Sith conspiracy, the story of an order of fanatical religious warriors attempting a coup during wartime is probably pretty convincing and justifies the heightened military state of the galaxy since Palpatine only took unlimited power! a year ago in the prompt. It'll take a hero with sources on the truth to radicalize him against the Empire, provided he doesn't just run afoul of a patrol and escalate the situation until the showdown becomes an inevitability. The most likely scenario for this is for Obi-Wan to find him first. EDIT: I just remembered an exchange I had in this sub from years ago that makes this significantly more lopsided in Stark's favor. He's Terran. There are no midichlorians on Earth, making him a functional ""dead zone"" to Force powers much like the Vong were, and quite possibly anomalous enough for Obi-Wan to take notice that something is weird."

There won't be any physical side-effects & difficulties like the obvious ""gravity crushing weight"", or ""can't breathe"", etc.. the humans and their remains simply scale by 100x and keep functioning on a relative level i.e. as if you're normal, this includes the height of fall damage being scaled by x100, dung size, red blood cells, movement speed, appetite, etc..

It's a normal night in Gotham, so Batman is allowed to intervene if he hears what's happening. How well does Wick do?","John Wick could probably take out Penguin and Two-Face, but the Joker? That's where it gets messy, especially with Batman lurking around. First, Wick absolutely wrecks Penguin at the Iceberg Lounge. A nightclub is basically Wick's home turf. He's dealt with worse goons in similar places, so getting through the guards is just another day at the office. Penguin himself doesn't stand a chance once Wick gets close. The only real problem is time—if Batman gets wind of this chaos, Wick might need to book it fast. Two-Face in the GCPD van is trickier. Wick's done ambushes before, so he'd probably have a solid plan to take out the convoy, but Gotham cops are used to dealing with lunatics and heavy firepower. Wick's good enough to avoid collateral damage, though, and Two-Face wouldn't last long once Wick gets to him. The wildcard here is Batman. If the Bat shows up mid-ambush, Wick's night starts falling apart. He's not equipped to deal with Gotham's favorite vigilante while still staying on mission. Then there's the Joker. This is where things really go sideways. Joker isn't just a target; he's a chaotic wildcard. His warehouse is guaranteed to be filled with traps, weird booby-traps, and a bunch of crazy thugs. Harley's in the mix too, and she's no pushover. Wick could probably mow through the thugs, but Joker's unpredictability could slow him down too much. And let's be real, this is prime Batman intervention time. If Batman hasn't stopped him by now, this is where he shows up, because there's no way the Bat's letting someone execute Joker—even if it would save Gotham a million headaches. In the end, Wick probably takes out Penguin and Two-Face, but the Joker either escapes through his chaos or survives because Batman gets in the way. Wick doesn't lose often, but Gotham is built to make guys like him have a really bad time. Two out of three isn't bad, though, considering how insane this scenario is."

"argumenta sobre: Superman VS the most efficient use of his powers in the irl world aimed to help people. If superman was part of the real world, catching criminals and saving people falling from buildings would be commendable, but I think his powers could be used in far greater tasks that can help humanity in a larger scale. In which ways you think Superman could use his powers to achive that kind of results? I've seen thrown around the idea that Superman could power a generator to give free energy, but that sort of solution is short sighted just because he is a person, and that comes with needs apart from regular sustenace that his power set covers, like not getting bored to death. He would need breaks and have time to live his life so a solution like that should be ruled out IMO.","The obvious thing is to devote his time to providing swift and efficient relief to areas affected by war or natural disasters. It won't be a total fix and politics will still get in the way, but a guy who can just casually fly across the Atlantic carrying a few tons of supplies for essentially free would sure help a lot. Aside from that, I think the number one thing he could do is participate in scientific experimentation to determine the mechanism behind his superpowers. All he'd have to do is demonstrate his powers under an experimental setting and allow those phenomena to be studied. Imagine if, for instance, we learned exactly what physics are responsible for Superman being able to fly around the world and even into space with no visible means of propulsion, and then figured out how to build a vehicle that uses the same principle. Goodbye tyranny of the rocket equation, hello space age. Imagine if we synthesized a material as tough as his super skin, or even learned how he's able to absorb so much energy from sunlight. It may take decades to yield anything practical, but in the long run, it will have a far greater impact on the world than anything a single man can do."
"argumenta sobre: MCU, Endgame Spoilers Doctor Strange gains all the powers of the Scarlet Witch and becomes The Witch Doctor. Who is the strongest character he can defeat? The Master of the Mystic Arts himself somehow gains all of the powers of a post-Endgame Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch. He now becomes The Witch Doctor and is on a bloodlusted mission for total domination of the MCU. Powers and Abilities All the knowledge and mastery of The Mystic Arts, learned by Doctor Strange up until the end of Endgame All the powers of Scarlet Witch she had up to the end of Endgame including her mind control/manipulation powers used in Age of Ultron Killer cleavage Note: He does not have the Time Stone Any character currently established in the MCU has a shot of going one-on-one with the Witch Doctor. The fights take place in the final battle site of Endgame. They are all at their peaks, and I'll mention the following few because I think they'd have the best chance. The Ancient One Iron Man in the Mark 85 Captain America, welding his shield and Mjolnir Thor, post Infinity War with Storm Breaker Endgame Thanos, with his sword and just the Power Stone Captain Marvel Any other MCU characters are fair game for a one-on-one Ultron, Vision, Hulk, etc. Can anyone put him down? Who is the strongest The Witch Doctor can defeat? Does he conquer the MCU? Bonus Round If no one in the MCU stands a 6/10 chance of winning, who is the strongest the Witch Doctor can beat in the 616 Comic Universe? In the Bonus Round, The Witch Doctor is given the Time Stone.",The strongest character he'd be able to beat is a Thanos w/ 5 stones Time stone excluded
"argumenta sobre: Could Light Yagami kill every human on Earth? The story of Death Note begins as it usually does, with Light suddenly receiving the Death Note and using it to kill people. Unlike in the original story, Light decides that he's going to wipe out the human race. Can he do it without being stopped? Assume that Light is bloodlusted here: he'll do whatever it takes to succeed.",He doesn't have time.

"argumenta sobre: 100,000 samurai vs 250,000 Roman legionaries 100,000 samurai led by Miyamoto Musashi in his prime. 20% of them have 16th century guns. They have a mix of katana, bows and spears and guns. All have samurai armor vs 250,000 Roman legionaries wearing their famous iron plate/chainmail from 1st century BC led by Julius Caesar in his prime Battlefield is an open plain, clear skies","The Samurai traditionally used bows as their primary weapon of choice, only engaging in melee skirmishes when absolutely necessary. The Samurai did have shields but were small and were used only when it was deemed tactically advantagous. Shields were not a vital part of the Samurai's fighting outfit so we can most likely count them out. The Romans were a well oiled machine with the tactics they employ centralising around the sword and shield. As stated the Samurai have 20,000 soldiers using guns with the addition of many more bows to fire volleys at the approaching Romans. If the Samurai could pick apart and route the Romans before they made it within melee range the Samurai win. If the Romans made it to the Samurai without heavy casualties their superior melee tactics and discipline should be enough to defeat and route the Samurai. Having a shield and tactics centralising around them is the Romans best strength in this scenario. I feel like in this situation the number advantage that the Romans have and their tortoise shield formation they would most definitely employ would be enough for them to meticulously edge forward and engage in melee combat to which they have all the advantages. And that's not taking into consideration any other tactics that they may employ in such a scenario."

"argumenta sobre: The Most Powerful Rock VS The Most Powerful Paper VS The Most Powerful Scissors Rocks, Paper, Scissors is a classic game of A>B>C>A. It's a fun little circle where no one is stronger than anyone else... but if Rocks, Papers, and Scissors were taken to their ontologically relevant most powerful forms, which would win? The most powerful Rock ever versus the most powerful Paper ever versus the most powerful Scissors ever! Which wins? - I was thinking the Rock would be something like Golden Kryptonite, Infinity Rocks, maybe high end Discworld Trolls. - Paper could be a Wish spell scroll, that infinite book that Superman and Shazam lifted, maybe the book from The Adjustment Bureau? Da Rules? - The scissors could be the scissors the Fates use to cut life strings, or the Killing Good, ""The Cutting and Severing Crime Edge"", or Ryuuko's scissor thing, or the Golden Blade from Flame of Recca.... etc Assume that any item can be used. If it's Gold Kryptonite versus Wish Spell versus Ryuuko's scissor, then the three items are used by three roughly identical individuals. If sentience is involved, then there doesn't have to be a wielder if you don't want. What wins? Rock, Paper, or Scissors in their most powerful forms?","I think scissors are going to lose this one simply because unless you include swords, there just aren't any really mythical scissors.

Bob does his best to be a hero while Val wants to parade him around and prove she's better than Vought, while taking over the corporation and exposing them which naturally draws the ire of the Seven. Bob is given the ultimatum that in order to go home, he has to kill every super powered individual Me personally: I think he takes it even without the Void because of his combat speed, matter manipulation, telekinesis, heat generation and durability and all this is without taking statements into play.

No water usage, just pure firepower from the M1 Abrams and the sandworm is aggressive and attacks the Abrams.","Glossu Rabban killed one by getting it to eat ""enough explosives to level a city block"", luring it into doing so with a thumper. The tanks just gotta let themselves get swallowed before shooting in order to bypass the worm's external durability, which isn't an issue since it's aggressive according to the prompt.

"argumenta sobre: A Message on AI Hello WhoWouldWin Community I hope you're all doing well! As your moderator, I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for your passion and enthusiasm in our discussions. It's incredible to see so many different perspectives and creative arguments about the battles between our favorite characters. Remember to keep the debates respectful and enjoyable for everyone. If you have any questions or suggestions for improving the subreddit, feel free to reach out. Your input is always appreciated! Let's keep the discussions going and continue to make this a great space for all fans! Best, Wait a Second …Something feels off, doesn't it? I would never say something like that! I hate all of you. Well, there's one simple reason behind this: I asked ChatGPT to write that segment up. Technology has progressed to such an impressive state, we're now able to flawlessly replicate the soulless husk of corporate America speak. With these newfound advancements comes one problem though… the bots are amongst us. WhoWouldWin is facing a serious concern of increased AI activity. Why is this happening? From what I've heard, individuals are farming accounts with karma with the intent of selling them off, but don't take that as gospel. What I do know is that these accounts have no place here. While I'm sure we're all looking forward to the Singularity as much as the next guy, and would prefer to avoid drawing the ire of Roko's basilisk, it shouldn't come at the cost of human inconvenience. Bots that do stuff like provide links to Respect Threads are awesome! A bot pretending to be a person? Not so much. We're banning them on sight. That's why we need you to stay vigilant and report false accounts. What to Look For - Karma: A botted account will typically have no posts of its own, and therefore only have one post karma point. This is different from comment karma, but please be aware this is not always true, and AI users are capable of having widely upvoted posts. - Name: These accounts are manufactured quickly, so they'll usually again, not always select the usernames generated by Reddit itself. That means anyone with a word, a second word, and a number for their username is a viable suspect. Strangely, a lot of bots come equipped with first names as well with Luna being a popular one in an attempt to seem more natural. - Comments: Pretty simple one, which I'm sure many of you have picked up on already. These accounts have a tendency to not contribute to conversation, in favor of expounding about the epic magnitude of the battle. And when they do select a winner, it's a wordy declaration, rather than an argument. They also really like exclamation marks for some reason. This one's easy. - Lack of Response: The dead giveaway in my experience. If you're worried someone was sent from Skynet, merely accuse them and see what happens. If you hear nothing back, you were right on the money. Please be aware this means we'll be taking a 'shoot first, ask questions later' approach whenever we're on the fence for banning users. If we thought you were a bot, tell us how stupid we are in modmail and you'll be unbanned right away. No harm, no foul. Closing Remarks So yeah, if we all work together, maybe we'll be able to make the dead internet theory a little less plausible, and put artificial intelligence back where it belongs: producing movies, television and video games. This is also a problem affecting subreddits others than , so spread the word and keep an eye out however you can. Unfortunately, all of this is a bandaid solution until the admins of Reddit up their game, but what can you do? If you're more of a visual learner however, here are some examples of AI accounts which you can study at home. All of these have been banned already, so don't worry about reporting them. - Example 1 - Easy Mode - Example 2 - Normal Mode - Example 3 - Hard Mode - As a heads up this account is NSFW Also please note that our 'no downvoting' rule applies to people only. We don't really care what you do to the fakers.","Yeah, the fact I never post anything myself could one day make people suspect I was an AI…"
"argumenta sobre: Could the Viltrum Empire survive in the 40k universe? The Viltrumites and all their conquered planets and territory are transported to the 40k universe. Could their physical power stand up to the sheer numbers and firepower of the Imperium or the Orkz, or would they not last against the established factions?","They'd probably be at their weakest and most vulnerable for like the first year or so, and get progressively stronger as time goes on. About two decades is when they're functionally out of control and are an End Times scenario for most factions who can't do something like hide in the Eye of Terror or the Maelstrom. Sources of ahem, breeding, are more common in the 40k galaxy, and the Viltrumites have better logistical, strategic and intelligence gathering capability than pretty much anyone in the galaxy with a few exceptions. A single very determined Viltrumite can restart their race into sizable numbers, and the discovery of humans en masse would accelerate the ""breed them"" strategy almost immediately. PFP Viltrumites are borderline unstoppable and the things that can harm them are often rare, hard to hit them with and arguably causing self-harm. Combined this with their logistical and strategic dominance relative to the setting, the Viltrumites basically own the galaxy outside of Chaos related enclaves within 20-30 years."

Would he end up killing himself cus his will to live will run out due to the hellscape of a job market we have? Will his relationships be even worse here? Will he get an even worse marvel treatment in real life? How long before cops or high level organised crime members get rid of him? Could Spider-Man be an actual threat to crime lords in new York? Would he get Paul'd? Is he gonna put dirt in your eye? Would he smack Andrew Tate?","Spider-Man has superhuman abilities. He's like a god. Plus, he's basically a genius. Already, his strength and speed break the laws of physics for wet bags of meat supported on a skeleton of bones and gristle.

"argumenta sobre: A single Space Marine WH40k is dropped in the French Countryside in 1940. Can he kill Hitler? Let's say it's an average Ultramarine. The Marine is drop-podded just outside of Hasparren, France on January 1st, 1940. Hasparren is close to the southwestern corner of the country, for reference He is equipped with nothing but standard Primaris Marine armor. He only knows he must kill a man with the name of Adolf Hitler. He does not know the landscape or anything about the war, nor where Hitler is exactly. He must get all of his information from talking to locals and interrogation Or as somebody in the comments pointed out, cannibalism.","As long as he doesn't try to facetank anti-tank weaponry, he should be able to do fine. He is fast, can be sneaky when he needs to, can tank most minor weapons and avoid or dodge the rest. As someone else said, he can eat people to gain their memories to figure out where Hitler is, thw Germans doesn't really have a way to track him, he can keep going for a long time and doesn't need to sleep much if at all, and can just hightail it through the countryside, only engaging when he needs too. When he gets to Berlin, he can hide in the sewers or jump from rooftop to rooftop at night, and then just bumrush the last ways when he finds Hitler. His personal guard won't be carrying anti-tank weapons in his bunker or wherever he is, so when he gets within 1 km from him there isn't really anything that can stop him. 9/10 he can do it, he would be like a bulletproof captain America doing blackops. 1/10 some German antitank squad or panzer crew gets lucky and nails him if he stumbles upon6 a too heavily guarded area"

"argumenta sobre: Can 50,000 level 150 TarnishedElden Ring conquer all of WestorosGame of Thrones? So the Greater Will decided that 50,000 Tarnished at level 150 must go to Westeros to conquer it because thats what they do. The Tarnished cannot respawn upon death, but they can sit down at Sites of Grace that are 1km apart from each other that refill their Crimson/Cerulean Flasks, allow them to change spells, sort their storage and heal them of their injuries and afflictions that only they can see and use. They can also teleport to these sites of graces but only out of combat and 1km away from any enemies. They also do not need to eat and sleep and are just like they are in the game. The Tarnished will be a somewhat equal mix of Faith, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Arcane builds, each build making up 10,000 of the army. They have access to all weapons, armors, talismans, consumables and spells, including that from the DLC. They all have a minimum vigour of 50. To win they would need to conquer all the Westeros, defeat any factions and armies who resist them and have them all utterly swear fealty to the Greater Will voluntarily or force. The leaders of each faction can be spared if they surrender but abdicate their lordship to a Tarnished to take over. The Tarnished will invade by all seemingly being teleported by the Greater Will a few km from King's Landing where they will then begin their invasion of all of Westeros. The rest of the factions will only know about the Tarnished from word of mouth after they start invading and will want to defend themselves by taking out the threat. Can the Tarnished win conquer Westeros?","Tarnish stomp, especially if you have access to everything in game and the 50k are an equal split or faith, Dex etc. 10k mage users would do so much damage, factor in healers, tanks etc and I don't see how they lose."

Magneto is fully aware that the person is trying to shoot him but will let the person fire one time, exactly. 3. Magneto can be distracted or otherwise disabled and shot such as with psychic powers, and it will count.

To elaborate on what I mean, Mihawk now directly scales above characters who prominently use a sword in their kit.

For example, Superman has yeh sword of Superman technically, however he would not count, however Wonder Woman regularly has her sword so she does count. It may seem arbitrary but honestly using common sense should suffice.",If Trunks counts than Mihawk just outpaced many verses in one go.

Would be very surprised if less than half survived. You underestimate just how connected the world is.

I think civilisation in 10 years would look very similar to the way it does today, but with a bunch of safety/quick alert features incase something similar ever happened again. There'd also be a massive market for bottled ""It's just like Water, except it's technically 0.01% lemon flavoured"" type products."

This can something that is just weird ""Big booty anime girls are part of European heraldic"" or a very high acceleration of knowledge. Bavaria is not the best place to be in but also not the worst. Europe was somewhat in a phase of change during this time. The best thing he could do is to join a monastery with monks with hobbies. They are much more open to new stuff than the general republic and curious in general they tried a lot of stuff and were so bored they refined the brewing of beer. The monastery would be the best beginning, because there he could PROVE that he can provide something useful with his technology."

"argumenta sobre: Who would have the biggest impact; A man with a billion dollars who wants to do as much good as possible vs A man with 1 million dollars who wants to do as much harm as possible? A benevolent billionaire vs A malevolent millionaire. Since destroying things is way easier than creating things, I figure I'd give the good guy more money than the bad guy. The rules are simple. Both men are determined to do the most good/evil and will absolutely use every last dollar of their funds to do so. Both men cannot stop each other from helping or hurting people directly as in killing each other personally or hiring a hitman to kill the other. But they can try and stop or rectify each other's actions as in bad guy blowing up a library good guy funded, or good guy funding a relief effort after one of bad guy's crimes. The bad guy cannot be caught and tried until he runs out of money. Who will have the biggest impact in the end?","Depends on how you look at it really. A malevolent Individual with a million dollars to put towards invidious ends can do a lot of immediate and visible damage. On the other hand, a benevolent individual with a billion dollars to put towards philanthropic ends, if they are smart, can have a vastly larger impact... it would just be far less dramatic/visible and take longer to manifest. He will invest in infrastructure, set up/invest in charity organizations, provide funding for scholarships, humanitarian aid and education in impoverished areas globally, lobby for better laws, provide job training and employ ex-cons to reduce recidivism etc. it would be slow but 30-40 years or so down the line the net benefit would be greater."

There's an argument to be made that the pigs potentially win even if the humans keep most of their weapons, but without them it's not even close. Few things to note about pigs. What we call ""Pigs"" and ""Wild Boar"" are the same animal, domestic pigs VERY quickly revert to acting like wild boar if they get out of confinement. Wild boar are absurdly strong, to the point where for medieval hunting parties with boar spears and lots of people, it was still a cool notable thing to take down a large boar. Humans can probably survive inside structures for a little while, and use improvised weapons, but still though, the piggies win."

"argumenta sobre: The Real world where the wizarding world declares all out war against humanity. How long would the wizards last? Rules: 1. Its not a sneak attack. Both sides officially declare war. 2. Just wizards vs humans. No wizard sides with humans, no human sides with wizards. 3. All mystical creatures with minds side with the wizarding world. All others just live where they live, until they are iced by a death squad of human soldiers. 4. No side is willing to concede, its a war to complete genocide. 5. Only spells mentioned in books exist. You cant make shit up, like Hogwarts being shielded against conventional weaponry etc. Since there is no ""warheado dissapearo"" or ""Flako jacketo"" spell, so they cant do that.","This question gets asked a lot and the consensus is generally that humans win pretty easily. Guns, artillery, tanks, and aircraft are dramatically more dangerous than a wand and they don't require decades of training to learn how to use. There are also far more humans. Now someone always says ""but the wizards have access to things like time travel"". Yes but they're fucking stupid and utilize such world shattering power to help a 14 year old girl study for a test. The Wizards are so absurdly ignorant to how the human world works that doing things like say, assassinating the president and impersonating him would be unfeasible because they don't even know how a fucking car works. But even if they did kill the president, who cares? Human government and military units have decentralized power structures to prevent decapitation strikes. Even if some crafty Wizard manages to take out the prime minister of the UK that isn't going to stop the British armed forces from advancing into the bombed out ruins of Hogwarts. During the entire book series regardless of the potential of their magic they never seem to explore creative ways to use it. Maybe true creativity is a human trait, which is why despite being magically lacking it was humans that conquered the world. Then there's the ""technology doesn't work near magic"" which is absurdly vague, but seeing as fire still burns at Hogwarts is see no reason why the chemical reaction in bullets or bombs wouldn't work. Even if we wank the Wizards to assume they can hold their own they're outnumbered hundreds to one and humanity can replace lost soldiers waaaay faster than wizards can train new wizards. The wizards get absolutely stomped 10/10 times. And if you doubt my answer I ask you... If wizards would win the war. why are they the ones in hiding?"

"argumenta sobre: What is the least amount of powers/weapons/artifacts you'd need from the Marvel or DC universe to attain a godly amount of power? Now, of course you could probably say 1 item, because there is probably an obscure artifact called ""The Hand of God"" that gives its wielder godly abilities, so I want to make this more challenging. Say we have this guy named Joe. He can do everything a normal man can. Joe can get into most public buildings, take a plane to most countries, and if he asks really nicely, he can hitch a ride with Green Lantern or Star Lord and travel to some inhabited planets. &x200B; Basically whatever a normal DC or Marvel civilian/background character can do, he can. It is what he \knows\ that sets him apart. He knows exactly where every artifact of power is held, he knows exactly how to obtain every force or power, and he knows exactly where every mighty weapon or armor piece is held. With this knowledge, Joe wants to become one of the most powerful people in his universe, roughly on par with Franklin Richards, or Dr. Manhattan. The only thing stopping him is, well, everything. He can't waltz up to Thor and take his hammer, because even if he was worthy, Thor wouldn't let him have it and he isn't strong enough to take it. He can't just request a green lantern ring because he only has a normal amount of willpower. &x200B; So, to obtain godly power, Joe needs to be strategic. He needs to go for the easiest to access yet most accessible powe/weapon, and then use the powers or abilities of that thing in order to get another one, and another, until he is either able to reach a certain synergy between weapons or abilities that gives him godly powers, or until he is able to reach a power level where he is able to simply take that power from someone else, such as taking the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos. &x200B; The question is, how does Joe strategize? Which thing does he go for first? choose between the two universes, whichever is your favorite, and what is the most efficient way to get from that first step to the last? And just for fun, after having obtained these powers, either for evil or good, what would his super powered name be?","Since he can ask nicely for interplanetary travel, I'm sure he could swing some interdimensional travel as well. The Tower of Fate has all kinds of powerful artifacts and knowledge, and if he were to go there and study and gain mastery over them he would become Doctor Fate. From there he can go on to teleport around and collect everything else in this comment section"

Allied Mastercomputer I get with this thing, it's going to be more of a survival challenge/gauntlet that our favorite devil hunter would have to go through.

Would he be able to find a way to stop AM for good? I'd like to one what you think? Scenario set up: Dante is randomly flung into the world of I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, during the events of the book and of course at this point, AM has complete control over the reality that his circuits and being reside over. Yu could argue Dante has dealt with some of the stuff AM can dish out before, but would this reality manipulating, at the level that AM is capable of performing, be too much for the Devil Slayer or would he breeze through this stuff and get to AM's core or whatever keeps him alive and stop him for good? Would AM even care? Dante is half human, but let's be real here, human is the LAST thing you'd call Dante! So he may not receive AM's deep rooted hatred for humankind, but AM would still see Dante as a threat, easily the ONLY real threat AM has arguably faced at this point. Dante is a chatterbox so that's gonna piss him off too. So Dante's stuck within AM's constructs, what does Dante have to defend himself with? Devil Sword Dante His dual pistols Ebony and Ivory His Bike Cavelier for travel and combat His full Sin DT abilities All his STYLES That's what he's got. Can he survive/beat AM? Perhaps even save the humans that AM has tortured as well?","I have some thoughts about how effective or not AM would be against Dante, but in terms of Dante winning that's a moot point, imo. AM covers basically the entire surface of the planet, as far as I can infer. There's just no way for Dante to do anything against that. Dante can't destroy faster than AM can rebuild with the entire planet's resources at its disposal. In a larger DMC canon sense, he might be able to reunite the human and demon worlds, and the invading army of demons might be effective?

Unless China and Russia intend on building a fleet that could actually challenge the US Navy there's no ability for them to get to North America with meaningful numbers of soldiers, and 20 years is not a lot of time for something like that to change. If nukes were used the US would ensure if they were to die so too would all life in the Northern Hemisphere and blanket the planet in enough radioactive hellfire to kill us all, while using their navy to ensure no soldiers could get so much as 300 miles from the rest of the world's shores. It wouldn't require twenty years of prep. A new Iron Curtain would descend over global shipping, with the rest of the world banning shipping to North America and North American fleets convoy raiding everything that got too far from the shore on the rest of the planet. Both sides would use saboteurs to burn oil fields and send the power grids to grinding halts, and we'd all face famine on a global scale as our fields burned and our tractors ran out of gas. It would be a war like no other, and neither side would ever claim victory."

"argumenta sobre: Roman Empire at its peak Vs the Mongol Empire at its peak Assuming no civil wars start, who would win","Define peak? By territory or military strength. If the later then I think 10th-century Byzantine Empire will likely stand a chance, they were probably the most military capable period of the Roman empire, while the classical empire was larger in both manpower and land it was technologically inferior and lacked the military tactics and depth of the byzatine forces. The byzatine also had a lot of experience fighting against various steppe nomads.. Also at the that time Constantinople was an absolute fortress of a city which could be resupplied by sea. My thoughts, it will end in a draw. The empire forces will likely retreat to Constantinople, but the mongol's will not be able to successfully siege it. So a draw, but that Mongols will be slight favorites."

"argumenta sobre: A person with waterbending vs. a person with earthbending vs. a person with firebending vs. a person with airbending Four perfectly identical humans fight to the death. The arena is a relatively high-up, mountainous region with access to a nearby river and plenty of air currents. No sub-bending abilities i.e. bloodbending, metalbending etc. - Round 1: No prior experience with their new powers. - Round 2: They have one year to adjust to their powers. - Round 3: Same as R2 except sub-bending abilities are now allowed. Who comes out alive? Edit: the weather is sunny, but it's windy.","R1: The answer is earth. Water and air are both out because both are only damaging at significant speeds or immense control stopping the breath and/or spit/blood. Fire is also out because while it's the only inherently harmful element, it can't be controlled by a novice to the point of killing. Let's talk about heat. We see in the final season that Toph was able to bend a suit of metal around herself. She was slowly being cooked alive, but even the captain of that airship I think it was the captain, who should be an experienced bender with years of experience in the military and Sozen's Comet backing him, couldn't outright melt metal. Scale that down to a novice and... it's not that impressive. The most dangerous strikes we see from fire bending masters like Iroh, Azula, Ozai, etc. are all done with a ton of explosive force, either as a flamethrower or as a fireball that explodes to transmit concussive force. True fire isn't like that though. It's the fourth state of matter after gas and their attacks would have to be condensed to a scary degree of mastery. This is actually the problem with fire bending. Master Jong, who initially taught Aang, described fire as ""alive,"" something that will devour the user as well as his enemies. Aang, sure enough, burned himself too. A novice using fire bending, against three opponents, would be more likely to hurt himself than others. We also see that the wide ribbon of fire that burned Katara... only burned her hand. Yes, it's a big deal at that point in the story, but a she's like 12 and it's a big ouchie, b the focus is not on the severity of the wound, just Aang's immaturity and unpreparedness for fire, and c Katara got her healing water skills out of it. Aang's attack with fire would burn. It's flashy. But... it doesn't have the heat nor the explosive force to deal the kind of damage needed to kill a man or a 12 year old girl for that matter. Earth bending runs no risk of harming the user, unless he's stupid enough to start a landslide and stand at the bottom or something. It is the most immediately powerful, requires only the mental focus to ""shove"" the earth, and can be very hard to block. There's also the martial art to consider. Water and air are both ""soft"" styles. They don't move intuitively for what most people would see as ""combat."" The emphasis is on dodging with those elements while earth relies on short, quick bursts of motion grounded in stable footing. Earth is obviously the more direct, and therefore more likely to be learned quickly by a novice. So yeah, earth. Not fire. R2: Air likely wins. Technically, bending the breath isn't a ""sub-bending."" It's also the easiest to learn as it doesn't revolve around power, just concentration. None of the other elements are so all-consuming in how it surrounds the opponent. Yes, choking isn't immediately fatal, but it does make movement incredibly difficult and focus almost instinctually impossible. Add this to the naturally avoidant martial art that the Air Nomads used and you have a style that basically dances around the opponent until they choke to death. I really do think the Air Nomads only lost to the Fire Nation due to their reverence for life. R3: Air or water are equally dangerous. Blood, breath, and anything else that affects the body directly is overpowered here. I would include lightning, but lightning in AtLA isn't real lightning. It doesn't travel at a third of the speed of light. It doesn't bounce back lightning is actually two bolts, one from the sky and one charge from the earth. It can be channeled and bent. It doesn't follow magnetic poles. And earth... irrelevant unless someone figures out how to bend iron in the blood or something."

Like in the game, he can swap to any COD weapons, and they don't require reloading and have infinite ammo.

The Marine is probably going to likewise just gonna 1-2 shot and he's using a fully automatic weapon at that. Combined with the fact the marine has superhuman reaction speeds, he's going to quickdraw and fire first and I don't think COD has any actual guns that can kill a marine in a meaningful amount of time unless you took some hyper literal interpretation of the Wunderwaffe or some of the newer games introduced weirder shit."

argumenta sobre: An average men's collegiate basketball team from 1920 vs the reigning WNBA champions Who do you think would win between the 2024 WNBA Champion New York Liberty or an average men's collegiate team from the 30s? I'm talking before integration and they're malnourished from the Great Depression. It would be today's rules but the team from the 30s gets 1 week of practice to get used to the rules. Edit: Sorry I meant the 1930s,"If it's today's rules, WNBA is almost certain to win because of 1 superior shooting and floor spacing, and 2 dribbling today simply looks nothing like dribbling back then. The 3-point line didn't even exist until the 1980s. Old timers are going to struggle to wrap their mind around how a modern defense needs to move and how to guard players out to 3, and they're certainly not going to be bombing 3s themselves the first guy who could probably replicate modern volume 3-point shooting was Pete Maravich and he mostly played in the 1970s. On top of that, the old heads have no experience guarding against a modern crossover, not to mention in and out and hesitation dribbles. Even if they're stronge not clear to me, but let's assume, they have no experience guarding the level of misdirection we have now. And guarding the old heads is 1,000X easier because they are basically running a church league motion offense with straight line drives and predictable passing lanes. This question is a little more interesting in later decades but I think people really underestimate how much the sport has developed in the last few decades. The sport looks nothing like it did in the early 1900s."

They were to receive all the tanks in 1938, along with 30,000 rounds of tank ammunition and 50,000 liters of fuel. The tanks they will receive will be the T-64BV model, and they will be trained to use them by 40 Russian soldiers. T-64","If the vehicle are integrated well in the Greek army of the time they could dominate easily the ground war, the real question is wether the Germans decide to commit a larger part of their Air Force and navy to the Greek campaign, I kinda doubt that because they had other more important fronts to worry about at the time. The most likely scenario imo is that the Nazis do not come to Italy's aid and consider Greece a ""problem to deal with later""seeing the new armored threat; Italy loses the Greek invasion and most likely this will fumet the malcontents in the population and lead to a more widespread partisan uprising earlier than in our timeline. But if Germany decides to commit more forces I don't, the tanks will be useless against the luftwaffe and if a a bomb is able to destroy a warehouse where the ammo and the spare parts are stored the tanks will have a short life."

In what sports does he gain no advantage in? This man is 25 and of average height, weight, and strength. He flies via ""walking on air"", meaning he does not grow wings or have to flap his arms or anything; rather, he needs to move his legs as if he were walking/running to fly.

For example, if he is flying at 5m/s, he would be spending the same amount of energy as if he were running at 5m/s. This applies to flying in any direction. He still takes fall damage but, of course, he can still control his downward speed to make sure he doesn't take a hard fall. There is no height limit to his flying.

"argumenta sobre: Is it posible for someone to be a functioning member of society if you are stuck in one frames per second? To those of you who do not play computer games I will break down for you what that means.

This is the least amount of frames I will play with before calling it a night. 7 is the least ammount of frames you can have and still be playable at all. It updates frames very slowly and while you can still play in theory it isn't fun at all. At 1 frame per second things get very surreal, dialogue comes out like.

People unfamiliar with how rules change fighting assume one great fighter must be great in all things. It's a bit like how people ask if a NBA or NFL athlete could beat a smaller MMA champ, but less so. Other examples - Olympic and national level wrestlers losing in MMA. Clarissa Shields is often considered a W boxing GOAT, and she lost to the lowest of the low-tier WMMA fighters. Kickboxing is an entirely different game to boxing, the ability to use your legs changes things, and Tyson is completely unprepared for it. I have no doubt if Tyson training Kickboxing early he'd be great at it, but if you're taking him in his prime and just teleporting him he'll get minced up from attacks he has no ability to defend."

"argumenta sobre: How many titans and pilots titanfall could composite master chief halo series destroy before he is stopped? Master chief has access to an arsenal of weapons from all of the Halo and titanfall games, he is given a jet pack, and he is debriefed on titan weaknesses and their batteries. He has cortana. The pilots won't know who chief is prior to the battle beginning. They'll have a rifle/ shotgun, anti titan weapon, and pistol; the pilot types will be equally distributed as are their weapon types Pilots win if they kill/ capture chief. Chief wins if he destroys 200 titans","Lets break this down into it's constituent parts, shall we? • Chief vs Dismounted Pilot: Surprisingly even. Both move and fight at 30-40 mph speeds, both are trained for extreme accuracy during acrobatic manuvers. Chief has much better armor and energy shields. The Pilot supplements their lackluster armor by having ridiculous movement speed and lots of utility tech. Chief has superhuman reflexes, while a Pilots are peak human. In terms of weapons, they are again fairly even. Chief could shred the Pilot even with a MA5 standard UNSC assault rifle, let alone a Covenant beam rifle or Forerunner weapons; provided he gets a clean shot. On the other hand, only the Pilots strongest anti-infantry weapons would even hurt Chief Marksman rifle, Spitfire mg. However, anti-titan weapons would be fully capable of laying Chief low. Slight edge for Chief. • Chief vs Standard Titan: Chief is badass, but a Titan is going to be a challenge for him. Titan weapons could likely oneshot the Spartan, due to sheer size. Chief does have the weaponry to put one down; SPKR rockets, fuel-rod cannon, or Spartan Laser would do it, let alone a Forerunner anti-vehicle cannon. The trick would be surviving to put enough ordance on the mech to bring it down. Standard Titans are dumb and use rigid tactics. They make up for this with energy shields, and advanced defensive tech; like the ability to magnetically catch enemy ordance and throw back, or teleport. A plasma sword, plasma grenade, or spike grenade in a Titans battery port would cause crucial damage; and Chief can certainly get that close, as Pilots do it fairly regularly. It would be alot like bringing down a souped up Scarab without using a vehicle, tough but doable for Chief. No edge given. • Elite Pilot and Titan vs Chief: This is where it gets interesting. Chief rarely faces foes as wily and intelligent as an elite Pilot, or as powerful and graceful as an advanced Titan. It's basically like fighting a 20 foot tall Spartan, even before the Pilot actually pilots the Titan; making it even more effective. Chief would have to do something special to overcome even one of these teams of man and machine. Edge Titanfall. Overall: I think Chief could overcome swathes of lower rank Pilots and even their mass-produced Titans, but would stuggle against someone like Jack Cooper and BT. Edit: Gave Titanfall some more credit, I forgot some of their good stuff in the first draft. Also added a little more info on both sides, and used more accurate wording. Formatted for readability. Same conclusions."

argumenta sobre: T-Rex vs a guy with an AK-47. Round One: Has never shot a gun before. Round Two: Has had some training. Round Three: He's a soldier.,"The man wins in rounds 2 and 3. After the first shots, if the TRex survives, it is more likely to try to run away than attack the man. It's a very big risk for little meat. As for round 1, it really depends. The man can underestimate the recoil of the weapon and get confused, or he can have theoretical knowledge and apply it decently. I would give the TRex more chances here, most people would have trouble handling a high power and recoil weapon like the AK47 without ever having handled a weapon before. It's worth mentioning that I don't give 10/0 to the man in any situation, as he may despair and get all messed up, as the TRex is truly a frightening creature, although this is less likely to happen to a soldier, due to the fact of having gone through real experiences and with some risk."

I feel like it'd be a similar situation to the Courage vs. Scooby Doo fight, where they don't have a way to get past the other's regeneration/Toon Force. I mean, we've seen both of them get crushed flat, cut into pieces, cut in half, burnt to a crisp, and they still got back up. I do remember that other characters in Looney Toons like Bugs and Daffy have taken the pen from the writers and animators to change the story, which I don't remember if Wile E. Coyote or Tom have done that, so unless Wile E. Coyote can do that, then I think this'll be another tie.

"argumenta sobre: Who could win, Rambo vs. Predator, the one from the first movie? They both fought in the jungle, only the Predator attacked an entire team, and Rambo is an expert at fighting at a disadvantage. , knows how to hide and ambush, who could win","Rambo makes the Predator work for it, but I think the Yautja has to win this one. It wouldn't have the rest of the team to pick off, and could focus its attention on John from the start -- giving it an advantage. Also, he wouldn't have the benefit of seeing the Predator's tactics beforehand to observe and learn from, since he's alone. So John's at more of a disadvantage than Dutch was in Predator. Though I think it's possible no combat at all. Rambo would only attack if provoked, and would probably try to flee the jungle before defending himself. The Predator doesn't generally attack unarmed people, so it may not see Rambo as a threat or worthy prey."
"argumenta sobre: Ironman MCU vs. All of his previous villains. Ironman is how he was in Infinity War. The villains are Iron MongurIM 1, WhiplashIM 2 and Killian IM 3 The villains have a 2 hours of prep and will meet Tony in the setting of the final fight in Ironman 2. This is a 3v1. All villains have their fully upgraded, EoM suits if they wore one. The villains have as much knowledge of Stark's current suit as a very informed bystander would have in the MCU. I think this would be a stomp for Tony, but I'm curious if I am correct. Bonus Round: Infinity War Spider-Man takes each of them on individually. How does he do?","Of these three, Killian is the only one who poses even a remote threat. Iron Monger lost to a half-charged, barely functioning Iron Man suit. A couple well places missiles from Friday it wouldn't even be worth Tony's attention could deactivate his armor. As for Whiplash, he's not ready for the raw firepower coming his way either. Even if he got a couple hits in which is doubtful, because of the raw speed on this new suit the nanotech would be constantly repairing it. He goes down in a matter of moments. Killian has some impressive feats, of course, and I think he might be able to put up a bit of a fight before his inevitable defeat. The man is durable, and can regenerate if there's anything left of him. Fortunately for Tony, he's got more than enough firepower to wipe him from existence much the way the explosion at the end of Iron Man 3 did. In my mind, Tony bursts onto the scene, missiles whizzing in all directions, and all but blitzes Iron Monger and Whiplash. Killian will get a couple hits in, the suit will shrug them off, and then Tony will turn his full firepower on the last standing villain. Killian's got no defense for an offensive on that scale. As for the bonus round, I think Spidey takes all three. The Iron Monger suit is so clunky that webbing will probably stop it up, while Whiplash and Killian aren't quick enough to negate the evasion afforded by Spidey Sense. Peter may have some trouble taking Killian down he doesnt have the capacity to blow him up like Tony does, but I imagine he'll figure something out trapping him under collapsing rubble maybe? It looks like a nice day to be a hero."

Things are very different in countries with a history of communism since there really was no private sector. 28% of the workforce works for the government in China, down from 78% at peak. Oman and Cuba are the highest right now around 78% - they would be the least affected but also not much economic potential. Russia is a little lower on the list at 40%, but still very high I think Russia handles it best - more potential, they already suffered a massive economic downturn because of the war, losing 60% of their tax money would make it impossible for that to continue.

Alvin York is, with all due respect to Audie Murphy, arguably the United States of America's greatest war hero. On October 9th, 1918, York took part in an assault in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. York personally killed more than 20 Germans, taking out 35 German machine guns positions. Somehow, York managed to emerge from the battle not only unscathed, but with 132 German prisoners to 7 surviving Americans, including the German battalion commander, who had personally attempted to shoot York at close range and was, like every other German, unable to hit him. York was an excellent shot, having honed his skills hunting for food as a young man. Alvin York was also noted as a strong hand to hand combatant from his days growing up, and has a slight 25-40 pounds weight advantage on Wick.","I'll do you raise better as a Canadian: John Wick vs Francis ""Binaaswi"" Pegahmagabow. 500 confirmed kills, 454 captures, had a habit of sneaking into the enemy trenches at night and stealing medals and other pieces of uniform off of the Germans as they slept, used the superior albeit infinitely more finicky MK3 Ross Rifle, and one time during the Battle of The Scarpe, Francis raided the enemy's trenches for more ammo because his Machine Gun's position was running low. With all due respect to America, there's a reason the Germans called us the Stormtroopers of the British Empire during WW1"

"argumenta sobre: In a real war, who would be the 5 most effective and 5 least effective characters from Super Smash Bros Ultimate? Any war, such as WW, Vietnam, Civil War, ancient wars, or any hypothetical real life war 1. Based on gameplay feats 2. Based on lore/canon feats There are 70+ characters to choose from so I don't think 5 both ways is to much to ask. Edit: ok with what I'm asking you'd potentially end up sharing 20 characters. You don't have to do 5 for each category/round I'd like you to though and if you want, go ahead. I'd just like to see a few more than 1 for each category/round.","Based on lore/canon round 2: Top 5: 1. Kirby - Literally an eldritch abomination, could probably destroy worlds, which I guess would win a war for you. 2. Shulk - In his game's lore, he gains basically the power of a God. So that incarnation of Shulk is easily one of the most powerful beings you can take into a battle. 3. Robin - Basically just a brilliant tactician. If there's anybody who knows how to win wars, it's him. 4. Palutena - To be honest, I'm not too confident with the Kid Icarus series lore, but she is a goddess, and she has been shown to be fairly powerful, so I feel pretty safe taking her over a lot of the other characters. 5. Link - Maybe a controversial pick, but in lore BotW Link has the ancient arrows, which just blink stuff out of existence. On top of that, he's a good enough archer to be able to consistently hit things with said ancient arrows. If there's any huge threat on the battlefield, Link is a counter to it, as long as he can get within bow range. Weakest 5: 1. Duck Hunt - I think this is literally just a dog and a duck. Not even a particularly large dog. 2. Villager - He's just a regular child. 3. Isabelle - Like villager, but a dog. 4. Wii Fit Trainer - I don't see how much good a yoga instructor will do you in a war. 5. R.O.B - I think he's just a game console."

"argumenta sobre: Can Kratos, the God of War, beat God of War 2018? Kratos, after returning home from scattering the ashes of Faye and going to sleep, wakes up to find himself in a white room. The only other object in the room is a TV and PlayStation 4 Pro with the game God of War 2018 loaded to the main menu. A mysterious voice tells him; ""In order to be free, you must recount your journey."" Kratos, while in this room, doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep, etc. The TV and PS4 are indestructible to any damage and have an unlimited power source. Kratos has access to his full inventory; weapons and runes, etc, from the end of his journey, with the exception of Mímir. R1 - Given an unlimited of time in this room, can Kratos beat God of War? Kratos can fully understand the text and language. R2 - Kratos has 1 week time. R3 - Atreus and Mímir are there to help him, 1 week time to beat the game. Game is in English, Atreus and Mímir can translate the game. Bonus round - Kratos at the end of God of War 3 instead, unlimited time.","People commenting no to the one week scenario might not be taking into account that he doesn't need to sleep eat etc in the prompt. That means he has around 170 hours of playtime to do it. A controller will be abstract to him, but the buttons are labelled and really it's not awful. Anyone who's given someone who's never played a game before a controller knows that it's difficult at first, but they have the basic feel of movement etc down fairly soon, even if it's sluggish. Granted Kratos doesn't actually know about modern technology and the concept of buttons and joysticks, but it's still a fairy simple device and things are clearly labelled. A few hours to figure out how to hold the thing and that 'press x' means to tap x for a split second etc. I think he could have enough of an understanding of the controls to manage movement and things very awkwardly by the end of the first 24 hours no problem. That puts him at roughly the level of anyone who's never played a game before, with 144 hours to complete the main story on easy. He can do that no sweat. Games are made to be playable not just by enthusiasts and people with some level of talent, but also by the lowest common denominator especially AAA games and Kratos, although short tempered, is undoubtedly much more naturally talented than a large amount of people that have beaten the game in real life. His biggest hurdle will be grasping the fundamentals of how a controller works, as well as camera controls, finger movement, and a basic feel of where buttons are without having to look down. I don't see that taking for than 24 hours if a normal first time player played in 2 hour sessions that's 12 DAYS of playtime. After that he has more than enough time to beat the story"

But what if Homelander got the same stats as Omni-Man himself? Circumstances: no prep and knowledge of each other opponent, random encounter. One-on-one fight, no assistance for both. Winning conditions: knockout, incapacitation or death. Nobody is gonna surrender or retreat. Characters' versions: composites feats from comics and their respective TV shows are allowed. Mindset: both are bloodlusted. Location: Staten Island, New York City, USA. P.S. - ""stats equalized"" means that Homelander in this exact case is as strong and as powerful as Omni-Man, basically. Same about his speed and other powers. But Homelander also remains his heat vision, X-Ray vision, enhanced senses and other powers that he already had.","Something I don't think anyone has mentioned here is that even if came down to a bloody, even fight, Nolan would still beat John. Nolan actually has experience fighting with his guts literally hanging out and his eyes popping out of his skull.

"argumenta sobre: Master Crane Kung Fu Panda vs Crane Hermit DB Crane vs Crane, probably not equal, but because they have basically the same name i'm putting them up against each other. Master Crane is fighting as he was in Kung Fu Panda 4, and the Crane Hermit is as he was in the 23rd World Tournament in Dragon Ball.","All things equal concerning world physics, Crane Hermit should take this due to mass. Master Crane should be at most 30 lbs, while Crane Hermit is around 120-130. The power generated by Crane Hermit would easily injure Master Crane, and since he is a bird, any injury to his wing will heavily disadvantage him. When Flight is considered, Master Crane knows flight as well and can shoot ki attacks. Now if we are to consider that Master Crane's mass can be neglected as he can be seen fighting heavier opponents without easily being injured, it would be a good match but Crane Hermit would still go on top more often because of said techniques. Master Crane would win on matches if he goes on the attack and takes advantage of his speed on an aged Crane Hermit and goes for killing strikes with his wings which he never really does since he is from a kid's cartoon. tl;dr With world physics being the same for both: Crane Hermit With world physics of their respective shows only affected them: Crane Hermit often than not, but Master Crane has a shot."

"argumenta sobre: What character, if inserted into the ending of Titanic, could save Jack Dawson so thoroughly that James Cameron couldn't rewrite the script to ensure he drowns in the Atlantic? James Cameron has previously said, in response to Mythbusters showing that Jack could have been saved, that if that were possible he'd just have rewritten the script to doom him again. Suppose that some powerful character were introduced into the script by accident somehow. Every scene up until the scene with the door where Jack drowns has already been filmed and cannot be modified, with this new character already hanging around or established as part of the setting. In fact, this character also now exists in reality, and was hired to write themselves; as part of their contract, they get to write all of their character's own actions but not the rest of the script. James Cameron receives an initial draft of the script for this scene, and this character now swoops in and saves Jack. Cameron is determined to rewrite it the scene to keep Jack's canonical doom of drowning in the Atlantic or dying of hypothermia in the Atlantic, but he must operate under a few constraints: 1. The chosen character will always be determined to save Jack, and will always do anything they can to save Jack. 2. After Cameron has rewritten the script, the chosen character gets to veto their own actions if they feel they're being written improperly, and can insist ""I would just do X"" if there's some obvious thing they could do to save Jack that Cameron has overlooked; in that case, the actions they insist on must be accounted for. Assume they are completely honest about this and will not just continue to find something to nit-pick every time Jack dies - they must genuinely believe that Cameron got their actions, capabilities, or options wrong and that their objection is one that would lead to Jack's survival, and will concede if there is genuinely nothing they could have done in the scenario Cameron devised. 3. The story Cameron writes must make sense, have at least some degree of plausibility, and at least notionally stand as a coherent story. If Superman is introduced and tries to save Jack he can have Lex Luthor arrive to stop him because that makes at least some sense, but he cannot simply have Jack have a stroke and die, for instance. 4. Cameron cannot ask anyone for help with his rewrite and cannot do any additional research. You can assume he knows what casual fans of this character would know, but he doesn't know incredibly obscure bits of trivia unless it's common knowledge. 5. Every scene up until the drowning one has already been written and filmed, and reflect canon aside from having the chosen character hanging out in some of them; Cameron cannot rewrite them at this point and cannot add additional scenes prior to this one in the timeline. 6. Rose must also survive; both the chosen character and Cameron want that. Besides, this is a consequence of point 5, since scenes showing her alive in the present have already been filmed. Cameron's goal is to rewrite the drowning scene, under these constrains, such that this character cannot save Jack from drowning no matter what, while still having it be a coherent story. What characters exist that Cameron would be unable to prevent from saving Jack, even with near-complete control of the script? No omnipotent characters. Yes, we know that God himself can in fact sink that ship and save Jack at the same time, but it rather defeats the purpose of the prompt.","Simon the Digger could easily do it. Spiral power is so potent that it was able to manipulate probability itself to turn 0% into 100%. Even if Cameron wrote 'Jack dies' in big bold letters on the script it wouldn't matter, he's getting saved."

"argumenta sobre: An unkillable immortal man is sent back in time to the Roman Empire, can he make it back to modern day WITHOUT going down in history? An almost-average American man is made completely immortal and invulnerable to all damage of any kind, making him immune to death as a whole. After this, he is sent back through time to the days of the Roman Empire, about 10 years before Julius Caesar is assassinated. Win Condition: The man must survive back to the modern day of 2025 A.D, however, accomplish this while also never ever becoming even a minorly notable historical figure at any point in time; if any modern historian has even a chance of knowing about his existence, he fails. Nobody has to know or figure out that he's immortal, and they don't have to know his real name or be able to connect it back to him in any way, all that matters is that he cannot become inscribed in the annals of history even as an obscure off-hand mention. He must also be reasonably sane enough to be able to reintegrate into modern society. This is to prevent him from just fucking off into the deepest reaches of Siberia and burying himself in an unmarked ""grave"" for thousands of years. If he did that, he would surely go insane, and thus lose. Rules of the Immortality: While he cannot die by any means, he still feels pain all the same as if he were a completely normal man, and while he doesn't need to eat or drink, he will still suffer the physical pain and/or emotional trauma caused by ignoring these needs. This goes for all bodily functions as well as psychological needs such as socialization. He is permanently stuck at the physical and mental age of 25 years old, though some aspects of his body can still change, he still grows hair, and still is capable of getting buff or becoming overweight. The Man: Height is 5'7, starts with an average build of a modern man who eats somewhat healthy and goes to the gym every other weekend, through his life he was always fascinated with history and has aspirations of working as a historian, studying the subject in his free time, but has no formal education in the subject. He speaks modern English and just barely enough period-appropriate Latin to be able to fake his way through a conversation with reasonable success, but absolutely nothing more, if he makes it past the Roman era or moves to a different nation, he'll have to either learn the language from scratch or find some way to live an unassuming, unnotable life without too much direct communication with others. EDIT: He is fully aware of his powers as well as the rules of the challenge, so he could possibly find and destroy anything that he knows mentions him, and he can wait to do it at any point in time prior to 2025.",">if any modern historian has even a chance of knowing about his existence, he fails. This is where my brain goes in stupid directions, because my immediate thought went to one historian would eventually find something that belonged to him, like a sword or even some money. Therefore, that logically means someone discovered he existed at some point, as in ""this belonged to someone in the 1400s."" But that doesn't really go with the theme of the question."
argumenta sobre: How many bloodlusted Teletubbies would it take to beat every European army? The Teletubbies are transported to Gibraltar. Their objective is to defeat every modern European army. How many of them would it take to complete this task? This is my first post here btw,"not enough to fit in gibraltar? Just one major european nation has a larger army than gibraltars population, so to fit them all in there wouldn't be enough space for the teletubies. Assuming the teletubbies are unarmed, I'll be generous and say each soldier can only take on 5 teletubies in reality they could easily gun them down in droves The UK military has 146,000 members, france has 426,000, germany 183,000, italy 165,000,spain 124,000. These 5 countries alone total almost 30 times the population of gibraltar. That means there would be 150 times the population of gibraltar in teletubies. Gibraltar has a population density of roughly 5,000 people per square kilometre 4959 but 5000 makes the maths easier teletubies bring that up to 750,000 teletubies per kilometre, or 0.75/m. This means each teletubby has just 1.3 metres each. considering the size of the teletubby, fitting any more in would be difficult. add in the rest of europes militaries many of which also have over 100,000 personel and possibly even russias military, and the teletubies don't stand a chance"

Special forces aren't super soldiers, they are highly trained infantry that specialize in unconventional tactics. In a line battle they aren't better than normal line infantry, usually worse as their kit isn't designed for that type of fight. That being said the Cadians take this handily. They're sensor suites are significantly better than the sensors the special forces have, meaning they would be able to quickly identify the special forces and call down fire missions. Also I'm not entirely certain that special forces has anything capable of bringing down a leman Russ or Rogal dorn tank. The other issue is the guardsman are basically guaranteed to generate fire superiority in any exchange due to lasguns.

"argumenta sobre: Infinity War except Thanos is controlled by Twitch chat. A Twitch Chat in another dimension is giving commands to Thanos in real time. It is full of tens of thousands of people who know the full plot of Infinity War, broadly want Thanos to achieve his goal of killing half his universe with a few trolls, and who don't view his universe as real. Thanos has no initiative of his own, but every second he picks a recent command at random and will intelligently follow it to the best of his abilities. He will not follow obviously suicidal or self-destructive orders. He will continue following commands unless a later one contradicts it so if he gets one command that says ""rub your belly"" and, later, another that says ""pat your head"", he will do both; but if someone then told him to do something else that required his hands, he'd stop. Commands can be complex long-term tasks so his response to a command of eg. ""get the Soul Stone"" will be to take whatever steps are necessary to find and claim it, without the need for individual commands. He will fight anyone who gets in the way of his achieving one of his orders, if fighting them is the best way to achieve it, so they don't need to give him individual commands in combat though they can if they want to. The twitch chat broadly shares the goal of Thanos winning to the same extent that Twitch Plays Pokemon wanted to complete the game, but there are a few trolls, stupid people, etc, and no formal coordination although some people can try and coordinate on Reddit, IRC, etc. How far does Twitch Plays Thanos get?

After you read the title all ocean bound life was granted an immunity to all the ills that aught to arise from their being brought ocean surface height and above. No longer is there troubles to be had by the above surface's spike in radiation, the lacking of depth pressure, the fish can breathe air, sonar users still function and so on. The whole nine yards of conceit is provided for them. A rancid fog of free floating organisms rise from the surface and spreads up to the land and into sky but we're not dealing with that. fish start to chase all the seabirds up into the sky. Tuna in groups of 20 to 30 go on the hunt for lions, and people by the beaches inhale and start to get eaten from the inside out by Plankton and corals taking root in their lungs.

"argumenta sobre: Guy who thinks he's a Jedi Vs Guy who thinks he's Jack Sparrow The guy who thinks he's a Jedi starts as a normal dude, but trains for 10 years to be a jedi. He trains himself in kenjutsu and wushu, and partakes in a lot of sparring with people of many different sword styles. To gain more experience, he takes part in the TSL championships every year. Also, he spends a lot of time practicing moves he sees in the Star Wars movies. A lot of his training revolves around meditation, and for physical training he goes for long runs in the forest with a yoda-size bag of rice tied to his back. He also does hand stands for long perioda of time while meditating. He also partakes in any other physical training applicable to his fighting styles. Through meditation and other forms of training, he has tried to train himself to stay calm at all times and have control of his emotions. His weapon is a Taijijian sword which has been made to look like a lightsaber the blade has even been made blue. Weaknesses: He truly thinks the force is real and may try to use it in battle. He may sometimes try to do things a jedi could do in the movies but he cannot. Finally, he believes in the Jedi way, and will try to avoid killing his opponents if possible. The guy who thinks he's Jack Sparrow starts as an average dude but trains for ten years to he a pirate. He'a spent that time training in pirate-style fencing fencing without rules, and has has done most of his fencing drills standing on narrow passages to work on his balance. A lot of his training has been sparring with advanced fencers. For physical training, he does things like lift and carry barrels from one place to another, along with other physical labor you'd expect on a pirate ship, and a lot of fencing drills. In a fight, he's willing to ""cheat"", such as throwing sand or rocks or anything else. His weapon is a cutlass which is an exact replica of Jack Sparrows. EDIT: NO GUN. READ PROMPT. JESUS. Weaknesses: He's perpetually a little drunk, and also thinks he has Jack Sparrow's supernatural luck. As such, sometimes he'll do things Jack Sparrow could normally luck his way out of, even though that's not how life works. R1: Fight takes place in an MMA octagon. Winner by death or surrender. R2: Fight takes place on an abandoned pirate ship. Winner by death or surrender.","The key for me is that the Jedi doesn't want to kill if he doesn't have to, and the Captain isn't afraid of cheating out the win. Most likely the Captain fake surrenders, the Jedi relents thinking he's won, and the Captain stabs him in the back. Captain Jack also has a pistol, so the Captain may take or try to sneak in a gun as well. And if he fires it, even a replica flintlock, I doubt the Jedi could deflect it with his ""lightsaber"" though he would definitely try."
"argumenta sobre: Could an average guy recreate the Mona Lisa An average guy with no artistic talent is trapped in a time loop that repeats every week. To escape, average guy must faithfully recreate the Mona Lisa, so that expert art analysts deem it to look genuine disregard cracks or signs of aging. At the start of the time loop, average guy has 24 hours to memorise the painting. After that, they're on their own. Edit: there is no memory reset obviously, and the guy can't paint during the first 24 hours. is that way too hard?","Unless his memory gets reset at the end of each loop, yes.

The Gauntlet includes all six canonical Marvel stones: Power, Time, Space, Mind, Soul, and Reality. We're taking the Chaos Gods at near-full warp power but not omnipotent.",If the warp is considered another universe/dimension then the gauntlet won't work assuming it even works in the 40k verse. Assuming it did then yeah hes pretty much omnipotent and controls all aspect of reality. Sure the chaos God's could just make another dimension within the warp but they cant do that if they are dead so yeah if it work then he could probably just blink them out of existence He could literally go back in time and prevent the horus hersey and ensure the emporer and sanguinius survives therefore chaos doesn't have a solid foothold in the galaxy.
"argumenta sobre: Can Count Dracula remain president for a full term without being impeached, arrested or murdered? Count Dracula has won the election with his charisma and now is sat in the Whitehouse. He has pretended to be another person, so nobody assumes that he is Dracula. Regarding his fangs, Dracula has proved it to be a medical condition. Can Dracula remain as president whilst still needing to get blood to keep his power?","Being Murdered isn't an issue. In fact he has a higher chance of dying by sunlight then being murdered. He's the president so he could do some changes to hospitals and get a couple of blood bags daily for ""scientific purposes"".

"argumenta sobre: Palpatine must use his considerable manipulative skills to turn somebody to the LIGHT, while Yoda must turn somebody to the DARK. Who wins? Palpatine is arguably the most manipulative individual in the entire SW universe, but could he turn somebody to the ""light""? In contrast, could Yoda -- a beacon to the light and the Jedi -- turn somebody to the ""dark""? Success will decided by these particular factors: How long it takes to turn their respective targets If their respective targets STAY in the light/dark R1: No Force abilities allowed that would do things like cloud judgement. Giving up would count as losing. Yoda's target = Luke ESB; Palpatine's = Dooku ROTS R2: Yoda and Palpatine can 'give up' for ONE day; if they do not return to turning their respective targets, they lose. Friends/Family/Allies etc. of the targets will show worry and may be able to tell that something is amiss. Yoda's target = Luke ROTJ; Palpatine's = Vader ESB R3: Yoda and Palpatine are allowed to bring in one individual to help turn their respective targets. This helper must be on the same side as them, i.e. Sidious cannot choose Luke. Friends/Family/Allies etc. know that SOMEBODY is behind things but not who. Yoda's target = Obi-Wan ROTS; Palpatine's = Vader post-ROTS, but pre-ANH Bonus: Palpatine has to convert a version of HIMSELF TPM to the Light-Side, as does Yoda -- but to the Dark-Side. Who is most successful?","Easy stomp, Yoda has. Ever-tempting, the Dark Side is. A quick, easy path to power, it offers. All Yoda needs is to advise, ""Fuck it. A bitch, you must choke. Better for everyone, that is. Ketamine, you should try."" Wow, that's tougher than I expected. Palpie has a much harder path.

"argumenta sobre: In 1997, most countries mysteriously disappeared, leaving only Switzerland, the Vatican, Laos, Nepal, Angola, the three American states, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay. Which country will become the superpower and conquer the most territory? People and buildings will mysteriously disappear, leaving only roads, bridges or historical sites such as the Eiffel Tower. The three remaining states in the US are Georgia, Illinois and Maryland.","This is a very specific question but it's actually interesting, especially compared to the recent crop of epic so random shit. First off, I view this as a contest between Switzerland and the American states. The Vatican is cooked, obviously, unless they just become part of Switzerland. Not that crazy since something like 30% of Switzerland is Catholic and I bet that number was higher 30 years ago. Laos, Nepal, Angola, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay are simply too poor or wracked with internal issues too become contenders. I anticipate that all of them would benefit, of course, and expand their territory substantially. However I think only Switzerland and the three US states have sufficient infrastructure, existing wealth, and the educated population to make a go of it. Roughly, Switzerland's population in 1997 was about 7 million. Maryland's population was 5 million, Illinois' was 12 million, and Georgia's was 7 million. I actually think population is a massive part of this because you'd need to spread out and start claiming territory fast, seizing the sites of now-erased mines and oil fields and shit like that. Honestly, I don't think this would result in war - all the nations would probably team up to figure out WTF happened. I guess it depends if they know they're in this competition or not. If they do, then maybe the Americans just drop a nuke on Switzerland in the first week of the contest before the Swiss can spread out and get to work properly."
"argumenta sobre: Character that is NOT from DC or Marvel or anything internationally popular in a who would win. I'm from Malaysia so I thought I'd take a character from my country and put him here for a battle. So there's this character in my country called Boboiboy. He's your average teenage superhero except imagine avatar + ben 10 + clonejutsu Boboiboy's powers and abilities: Has a watch that gives him elemental powers His watch can provide him elements from his surroundings though it takes a days to weeks for the watch to be able to analyze and give Boboiboy the powers Example: He stays at a magma planet and he gets the ability to control fire. He doesn't control his powers alone but he splits into multiples of himself with each using a different element and having different minds/their thoughts and actions can't be controlled by Boboiboy but he can undo the ""clone jutsu"" His elements upgrade and become stronger overtime. His elements include: Fire > Blaze Fire is well fire but with blaze he can create a giant meteor and send it down on his enemies Water > Ice Water can create miniature tsunamis and waterbend and ice can create massive ice mountains to freeze enemies and can create working weapons out of ice like a machine gun ice cannon lmao Lightning > Thunder I know lightning is the jolt of electricitt and thunder is the sound lightning makes but apparently in this show thunder is just lightning but faster and stronger Earth Basic Earth bending > Earthquake Can basically cause earthquakes and create things out of rock such as golems or fists the size of buildings and can control the things he made Leaf > Thorn Uses vines and leafs to fight and Thorns is spiderman but huge thorny vines Wind > Tornado Controls wind and tornado is just wind but 20x faster and stronger Light > Solar light is superman heat vision except that you can also release it from your fingertips too and solar is just beams of light except as hot as the sun and solar blasts Note: Using these abilities he can create stuff like lightning swords, ice cannon machine guns that can create ice mountains, massive fire chakrams etc. He can use all these abilities at once unleashing seven of himself each controlling an element. He can also fuse with others of himself to combine elements. Example: Ice + Blaze = Frostfire Here are some of his best feats: 1. Shoots a solar beam to destroy a black hole 2. Sends down a huge blazing meteor on an enemy 3. Creates a Giant Ice Mountain freezing his enemy 4. Creates a giant tornado to suck in an enemy, proceeds to turn the tornado into fire then proceeds to turn it into ice, freezing the enemy If you want to know more about him search it up on google and if you want to see his full capabilities search these fights up: Boboiboy vs Borara Boboiboy vs Reta'kka Boboiboy vs Captain Vargoba He has high durability being able to casually tank being inside a black hole. Yes I know the names are cringy His speed scales from high bullet timer to FTL. Speed feats: Escapes a black hole Catches Borara who is able to teleport Moves through huge distances in seconds Watch the Borara fight it's his best fight in the series His solar and light elements are able to manipulate photokinetic energy meaning he should have FTL speed He has good instinctive reaction by catching a shield flying towards him at high speeds Note: His lightning once managed to revert a crazed cat back to it's normal state meaning he might have low mind manipulation He also has the ability to perform multifold attacks which are basically attacks with tens to hundreds of times their power. He has minor resistances to: Poison, Radiation, Status Effect Inducement, Mind Manipulation, Sleep Manipulation Standard equipment: His elemental watch Ochobot WHAT is Ochobot? Ochobot is a power sphere that gave him the elemental watch. It's basically a robot ball that has human levels of intelligence, maybe higher. It can talk to Boboiboy like a human. Ochobot's abilities: Power Nullification Absorption Intergalactic Teleportation Analyzation of objects Hacking Power Bestowal Note: Boboiboy's power is weaker when he splits. Fusion is 2x stronger than using a single element but Splitting can also make a variety of combos and attacks for him to use. I'd say that when he splits into all 7 clones they are as twice as weak compared to when used alone. So, what's the strongest character he can defeat?",I assume people are researching on this character and what not so I'll check on this post tomorrow and see if there are any comments.

"argumenta sobre: Who could kill or capture the most rats in one hour: Charlie It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia or The Janitor Scrubs?

Arsenal: Charlie is equipped with the rat stick he received for his birthday, as well as whatever he chooses to bring from Paddy's Pub. The Janitor is equipped with whatever he can bring from the Sacred Heart Hospital janitorial supply. Feats: Charlie has had frequent encounters with rats, including finding and destroying a rat's nest, killing 200 in the process. The Janitor has been able to capture and taxidermy a squirrel army He has been able to almost completely rid the area surrounding the hospital of squirrels enough to make a noticeable dent in the population.

Round 3: Round 2, but the rats are replaced with squirrels.","Round 1: I'm going to give to Charlie 9/10 as the neutral territory Charlie is better at jumping to action right away whereas the Janitor doesn't do well in unfamiliar terrain many of the shenanigans participated in relied on in depth knowledge of the hospital. If we could get Charlie blackout drunk he'd be unstoppable Charlie-10/10. If there was a planning period though Janitor would gain an edge to mix chemicals to basically rat bomb the whole abandoned building/area, but I don't think he's crazy enough to do something of that caliber I'd say Charlie still takes it but at a 7/10 Round 2: Janitor takes this one 10/10 based on environment. We're counting points per rat killed or captured, Paddy's Pub is a vile cesspool of an area whereas Sacred Heart is mostly a clean environment. Just by sheer rat population numbers Janitor takes it. However, I'd be more concerned about the Janitor being overrun as he tends to be more one-on-one style with the killing.

The Terminator is the same as the first movie, with the same guns. Who wins?",Mark 1 weapons are a flamethrower and wrist mounted missiles along with a limited rocket propelled flight. Defensively it takes small arm fire pretty well. It also has enhanced strength. T-800 can tank small arm fire and has enhanced aim with weapons in addition to strength. It would be a good fight. If Tony can land a direct hit with a rocket he might pull it off.
"argumenta sobre: If soldiers treated their lives as carelessly and calculatively as pro gamers treated their characters' lives, in which historical battles/wars would the outcome have been very different? Some i'd like to hear about are D-day and thermopylae, but feel free to talk about any you're interested in","One aspect I've seen overlooked is that gamers are 96 percentage points more likely to virtually shoot to kill than IRL soldiers. There was a Prussian IIRC? study in the Napoleonic era where a column of 400 soldiers fired muskets at a cloth sheet the area and vague shape of another column and recorded 300 hits 75% hit rate, even with late 1700's muskets. Then in battle, the same column would be lucky to get 10% hit rates, since the vast majority of soldiers weren't shooting to kill. More rigorous studies into the mid-1800's found less than 4% of soldiers were shooting to kill when given the opportunity. By the 2nd world war, social conditioning and propaganda had improved and now 25% of soldiers, when given the chance, shot to kill. Moving into Vietnam, it grew to closer to 60-70%. So not only would you see greater willingness to die, but also greater willingness to kill"

"argumenta sobre: Once every 464 days, a monstrous bear appears in every building occupied by humans. How does humanity fare? Once every 464 days, a jacked up bear will appear in every building occupied by a human. It does not matter how many humans are in the building, it will always be a single bear. The bears are defined as follows: Twice the size, speed, durability and strength of an average polar bear. Physical appearance is glowing red eyes, 7 in claws, crimson fur Can see in the dark, vision unimpaired by things such as smoke or mist Always knows where humans are, and will not get distracted or stop to eat, sleep, etc. Otherwise intelligence is similar to that of a grizzly Fur is resistant to fire, sharp objects, and is hydrophobic. Is not immune though. Think of a kevlar jacket in terms of resistance Bears are bloodlusted. They will not give up pursuing humans, but will always attempt to maximize kills if human is behind door, bear will prioritize humans that are more accessible. If all of the humans are behind a door or similar obstacle bear will constantly attempt to force entry in any way it can with its limited intelligence Bear will not pursue humans outside. They are incapable of leaving the buildings they were spawned in, of their own volition. Should they be forced out, they will violently explode with the force to destroy a 1200lb boulder. Bears will only disappear 24hrs after they have spawned. They will simply vanish. If bears have been killed, the bodies will also vanish after the 24hrs. Attempting to remove a bear's body from the building will also trigger the explosion. If the bear's body is somehow seperated into pieces and said pieces are removed from the parent home, all parts of the body will simultaneously explode with the force evenly distributed amongst the pieces, scaled to said part. Bears will immediately know if humans enter the building after spawning, otherwise their knowledge of humans locations is restricted to their building If building is too small for bear to fit, it will spawn as a cub, with the same stats defined above but scaled to a polar bear cub If bear is killed, no more bears will spawn in that building for that cycle. Dead bodies will not explode unless removed from building. Bears shall NOT spawn in buildings that humans enter after the cycle day has begun if there were no humans in there initially FOR THAT CYCLE Buildings are defined as follows Anything that can be reasonably defined as a liveable shelter. Does not matter if it is closed off from the outside. For instance, a tent with its flaps open is defined as a building Non man made structures count. A cave will, for example, be defined as a building Awnings, patios, underneath overpasses, phone boothes, porta-potties, and the like are NOT defined as buildings. Bears will not spawn here All vehicles EXCEPT those such as campers, RVs, etc. are not defined as buildings For buildings such as apartments, hotels, etc. Special rules apply. Apartments connected via interior walkways count as one building, meaning only one bear will spawn. Apartments connected via exterior all count as seperate buildings, meaning each apartment gets a bear. Bears cannot leave their parent home, even if they do not go outside. In the above case, with apartments, a bear spawned in a room for an apartment connected via exterior means cannot tear through the wall to enter another room, as this would be entering a building that is not its parent building. Doing so will trigger the explosion clause Bear cycle rules below Humanity does not know the rules of the bears or the cycle, but can learn over time via deduction. Bears do not get stronger each cycle Bear will spawn AT LEAST 30ft from a random human in the building. No other human can be within this radius. If this is impossible, bear will spawn in a location in the building that most closely meet these specifications. This means bears can spawn closer, but will prioritize spawning further to respect the at least 30 ft specification. Bears will only spawn for 15 cycles. After this time, the bears will never spawn again On the 13th cycle, two cubs will spawn in each building instead of the one bear. Spawn is still restricted to buildings that are occupied by humans. The cubs will be as far away from each other as possible within the buildings boundaries, while still respecting the 30 ft rule, and will explode with 1.5x the force stated above after 12 hours. Explosion will not happen if cubs are killed. The affected buildings will no longer be defined as buildings if they collapse and are now unliveable, but if the buildings are repaired they regain their status as spawnable for the next cycle. This is the only time the cycle will differ from the norm. The first cycle begins on 2/3/23 at 10:37am US CST and will last approximately 24 hours, after which bears despawn. The next cycle begins in exactly 464 days and will continue every 464 precisely until the 15th cycle after which, as stated, bears will never spawn again. Win conditions are defined as follows Bears win if society collapses. Societal collapse is defined as world governments falling, supply chain collapse, basically society as we know it coming to an end. Think of reverting back to an almost tribal lifestyle. Humans win if they can survive 15 cycles without societal collapse. Many can die, life can be hard, but if we can maintain a semblance of modern civilization it is a win. Bears will stop coming after the 15th cycle as stated above. Humans have no prep time or warning. No one knows of the bears coming until it happens. As stated above, humanity does not know the rules but can learn over time via deduction BONUS ALTERNATE TIMELINE RULES BELOW Same rules as above, with some stipulations Human governments are warned that in exactly 464 days, all of humanity will face a massive attack. They are warned more attacks will follow after this one. This is all of the info they are given. They are unaware of the other rules. The governments may do what they wish with this info and share it with the population as they see fit Assume the governments will believe the warning, as they were given the information by an anthropomorphic monstrous bear that appeared before them Bears are now able to leave the buildings, but are not allowed to go further than 500 feet of the building they spawned in. Explosion rules apply should bears be forced out of this radius, though explosions are now large enough to destroy a 2 ton boulder. Scale the cubs on cycle 13 accordingly. Bears will prioritize their parent building. If there is another building within this distance, they may enter, but this does not reset their parent building Bears will now also spawn in buildings that humans enter that were initially empty on cycle day. Spawn time is 13 minutes and 42 seconds after human entry. Bears may not spawn more than once per building per cycle","The scenario where Governments aware of an attack on a certain day but nothing else is humorous. ""We are aware of an attack on this day but with no other knowledge, please lock yourselves in your rooms and safe havens and be safe until we determine the extent of the danger"""

The guy knows how to operate the gun and can aim ""fairly decently"". Firing a gun on full-auto is pretty difficult though, it's far harder to keep rounds on target than if you're firing semi-auto. And that's under range conditions. Trying to keep rounds on target when an elephant-sized predator is charging you and trying to eat you is going to be an order of magnitude harder. The guy also doesn't know where the T-rex's internal organs are and won't be able to land an instantly disabling shot. I think he'll probably hit it with a few rounds, but he's going to get killed. The T-rex may die later from its wounds but I don't think even that's a guarantee."

"argumenta sobre: Chancellor Palpatine cocks up and Executes Order 65 instead. Can he survive the Palpa-purge? Prompt: Palpatine is so ecstatic that he managed to turn Anakin to the Dark Side and mess up that arrogant Mace Windu, that he fumbles his words and Executes Order 65 removal of the Supreme Chancellor, by lethal force if necessary. Before Palpatine can correct himself and instead Execute Order 66, the GAR commanders either through the inhibitor chips or blind loyalty to the initial command disregard Palpatine's authority in order to enact Order 65 ASAP. Palpatine's right hand man Mas Amedda overheard the cock-up and witnessed Senate Guards amassing to confront Palpatine, and has decided to save his own skin. Vader meanwhile has gone to meet up with the 501st outside the Jedi Temple, assuming Order 66 is incoming. Can Palpatine escape Coruscant and live to regain the upper hand at some point? Stipulations: Palpatine's mistake is taken as a direct and valid order by all Clone combatants. Chipped Clones will simply Execute Order 65, non-Chipped military personnel Bad Batch, non-Clones etc will be in disarray, but believe Order 65 was issued when Palpatine attempted to claim ultimate power or oust the Jedi or something likewise nefarious to warrant Order 65 going live. Other players may be available for Palpatine to ally with, or may fall in line with the GAR against him depending on motives, persuasion, size of the opposition etc. This will take place at the same point in time that Order 66 would have been issued, ergo, Vader will be waiting to conduct Operation Knightfall, Ahsoka is en-route to Coruscant with Rex and captive Maul, the Bad Batch are with Kanan Jarrus and his Master, etc. Mace Windu and the other Masters who attempted the arrest are dead, otherwise the Jedi are at pre-Order 66 strength. Only Clones/GAR officials in the know of Palps identity of Sidious will initially have this knowledge, giving Palpatine a small window to either elude capture or neutralise those with knowledge of Darth Sidious's capabilities. Round One: Palpatine realises his mistake and manages to ambush a Senate Clone Trooper coming in to arrest him, before making the decision to flee before Coruscant goes into high alert lockdown. Word is beginning to cascade down from commanders who received Order 65, but lines of communication are slow enough to give Palps a bit more of a window. Vader is contacted by Palpatine, stating that the plan is off and Vader needs to help protect him to save Padmé. Whether this involves using Vader as a distraction or a bodyguard, is up to your interpretation. The Jedi and Galactic public are slower on the uptake. The GAR operates surgically to disseminate and distribute information where necessary, hoping a quieter approach may catch Palpatine off-guard. Round Two: Palpatine spends longer attempting to contact GAR leadership to try and undo his mistake, having no progress before a Senate Guard attachment breaches Palpatine's Office to open fire at him. The Senate building goes on high alert. Palpatine is unable to contact Vader for a change of plans. However, Vader picks up radio chatter about what's occurring at The Senate, and goes sicko mode blind rage fighting his way to Palpatine to safeguard the knowledge of saving Padmé. The Jedi and Galactic public find out about Order 65 pretty quickly. The scale of fighting in The Senate chambers prompt the GAR to go to red alert, strictest lockdown procedures to contain Palpatine and his new apprentice carving a path to him. Round Three: Unfortunately for Palpatine, Jar Jar Binks is revealed to have been hiding under Palpatine's desk the entire time. Either through secret Dark Side schemer machinations or slapstick stooge-mistakes, Jar Jar fumbles over a bunch of buttons on the Chancellor's desk, broadcasting extensively damning recordings of Palpatine as Sidious orchestrating the Clone Wars and planned purge/Imperialisation to a Senate meeting coincidentally called to discuss Blue Milk import tariffs explaining why Palpatine decided not to attend. More substantial GAR forces move in to intercept Palpatine in his office, turning the Senate building into a warzone. Vader initially hears the news and intends to rescue Palpatine, but upon seeing Holonet footage of Palps using Padmé and Organa as hostages, single-mindedly goes to rescue Padmé and kill Sidious. Likewise, the Jedi and basically everyone else with Holonet access in the Galaxy are immediately alerted to these developments. Bonus Round: Thanks to a risky and frankly impressive move pulling a Republic capital ship out of blockade orbit into the Senate building with the Force, Sidious has eluded capture and made his way to Malachor. He begins plotting his vengeance and seeking someway such as through Sith Alchemy, subterfuge, The World Between Worlds, etc to get back on track for ultimate power. He begins rallying Sith Acolytes to Malachor for his work. Meanwhile other forces are working to track down Palpatine. Anakin, rejecting his Sidious-given title of Vader, has found out Padmé was killed in Palpatine's escape and has set out with his own team of enlisted Force Users essentially every canon Imperial Inquisitor to find and kill Sidious. Yoda and Obi-Wan are attempting to guide the Jedi Council, mourning the deaths of their fellow Masters and will assist the GAR led predominantly by figures such as Tarkin, Rex, Ahsoka and Yularen in capturing Palpatine for arrest and trial. Maul has escaped Republic custody and retreated to his underworld contacts. He has set an extremely high bounty of 10,000,000 credits on Palpatine's head, with an extra 10,000,000 for successfully bringing his former master back to him alive for his personal vendetta. He has employed his Crimson Dawn associates, as well as working with the Hutt Clan syndicate to acquire this lucrative target. Figures rumored to be hunting the bounty include: Cad Bane, Jango Fett, Boba Fett, IG-88, Bossk, Fennec Shand, and Din Djarin. But half of them are dead or unheard of by this point... Aren't they? Which of the 4 factions manage to accomplish their task? TL;DR: Prompt: Palpatine accidentally Executes Order 65, making him a target of the Clones and Grand Army of the Republic. He can't undo it. Can he escape the Republic to fight another day? R1: Palpatine has a bit of time to try and escape or come up with a plan. GAR are playing things safe to try and ambush Palps; Jedi and the public are initially unaware, Vader can assist Sidious as a bodyguard or distraction. R2: GAR on high alert when Palps goes hardcore at the Senate. Jedi and general public now aware of what's going on. Vader pulling an extended Rogue One corridor sequence to try and save Padmé via rescuing Palpatine. R3: Proof of Palps being a mastermind and a total dick leaks to a live Senate meeting. Everyone on high alert thanks to Holonet news spreading fast. Vader is against Palps after learning the latter used her as a hostage. Bonus: Palps escapes to Malachor with Sith Acolytes to try and figure out a Plan B for ultimate power. Anakin pissed because Palps killed Padmé + all canon Inquisitors are hunting Sidious down to kill him. Jedi/GAR also inc Ahsoka are hunting Palps to arrest+convict him. Maul/Crimson Dawn/Hutt Syndicate have put a 20 mil credit bounty on Palps alive or half dead. Famous bounty hunters from across the Galaxy some a tad out of place chronologically including Cad Bane, Jango Fett, Fennec, Boba Fett, Din Djarin, Bossk, and IG-88 are all after the bounty. Which team completes their task?","Not technically relevant, but how fucking cool would a band of non-aligned inquisitors led by a morally grey Anakin be? In the middle of a hunt for the last Sith Lord, the Ex-Jedi is driven by vengeance, but he hasn't yet murdered the younglings and doesn't believe himself hat damned - his mistake at the window with Windu hasn't doomed the galaxy. Ahsoka could essentially take his place as the rogue hotshot of the Jedi order, and we could get a similar heart to heart as in Rebels"

"argumenta sobre: Who would win: A person who can dodge bullets, a person who can tank bullets, or a person who can catch bullets? Let's break down the matchup for more clarification: 1. The Dodger: They can evade bullets entirely, moving fast enough or having reflexes sharp enough to avoid being hit. 2. The Tank: They can withstand direct hits from bullets without sustaining serious injuries, essentially shrugging off gunfire. 3. The Catcher: This person has the skill to catch bullets mid-flight, either with their hands or some other means, stopping them before they reach their body. Conditions: - The three are fighting in an urban environment with moderate cover think alleyways, parked cars, etc.. - They have basic knowledge of each other's abilities but no prep time. - Each of them is trying to take out the others.

"argumenta sobre: If Ultron had beat the Avengers, would he have stood a chance against Thanos? Ultron would have the mind stone, time stone, and access to all of the Vibranium in the world. Personally, I think so. Ultron is a robot, who consumes nothing and can work endlessly without needs. Theoretically, he could have made an army of Ultrons and used all of the worlds vibranium for it. Ultron's army could have conducted experiments to advance his weapons and defenses surpass what Tony did to his suit to ""protect earth"". I'd argue Ultron is smarter than Tony, evident throughout the plot as he is nearly unstoppable until Vision is born. THAT being said Ultron could have a virbanium, nano-tech robots army of millions with the time and mind stones. He would also BE Vision. I.E have Visions powers.

And ultimately can the republic as a whole survive or will they collapse?","To everybody saying Saibamen are moon level, keep in mind that earth was explicitly noted to make the saibamen stronger than normal because it had high quality dirt, so the answer to this question largely depends on A. the quality of the soil of the planet they appear on B. Where they actually appear on said planet A saibaman appearing on Mustafar for example is probably fucked assuming it manages to sprout at all."
"argumenta sobre: The US military vs. a self-aware crab the size of Maine So for context: I had a dream that a crab-worshipping cult summoned a crab from beneath the arctic, and it took the entire whole of humanity to generate enough spiritual energy to defeat it.

Round 1: no nukes Round 2: nukes are allowed Round 3: MEGACRABAGGEDON!!! 50 crabs, each the sizes of one of the US states, begin their assault on the world. Could all the people in the world stop them?",Couldn't we pour some kind of acid on the crab to weaken its shell? Then drop a bomb in the hole.. like Starship Troopers. I think that bombs and rockets are the wrong approach... acid and poison ie chemical/biological warfare is the way to defeat this thing!

"argumenta sobre: Samurais Vs Ninjas. From real history. Both are 100 people strong. Both are at the peak of their respective historical eras. Scenario 1 - Open battlefield. Headstrong armies charging. Scenario 2 - urban setting, medieval Japanese city, streets surrounded by buildings and civillians. Scenario 3 - Ninjas on the way to infiltrate a caste, defended by samurais. Samurais know of the impending attack in the next 72 hours but do not know the exact date and time. Samurais and Ninjas are not from fiction thus no mysticism allowed. Only their designated weaponry when they were at their peak.","Ninjas are for infiltration, espionage, sabotage, and assassination. They rarely fought in battle with regular troops. Assuming they use ""ninja tactics"" instead of just charging the enemy: Scenario 1 & 2: Samurai water and/or food supply gets poisoned. They all die before the battle or are in no condition to fight. Scenario 3: It depends if ninjas get in the castle despite the samurai being alerted. If they do, they'll open the gates and/or poison the supplies. Maybe assassinate the leader and set the castle on fire."
argumenta sobre: Tu-95 vs A-10 guns only dogfight Who would win in a dogfight between modern versions of the A-10 and Tu-95 if they can only use guns? Obviously it's an attacker vs a bomber which doesn't make much sense but they do both have guns meant to be capable of killing other aircraft and at least in the same ballpark of burst mass. 20 kg/s The Tu-95 is also quite a bit faster in a straight line meaning that it can probably prevent the A-10 from chasing it and the tail turret is radar-controlled i.e. it's an aimbot and has something like 60 degrees of traverse in all directions except only 40 degrees of depression. It only has about 500 23mm rounds as opposed to 1125 30mm rounds for the A-10 so clearly there is a lot less ammo for the Tu-95.,"The Tu-95 cruises just shy of the A-10's clean max speed. Which means the only way for the engagement to happen is a closing head on engagement, or a front quarter interception. If the A-10 can close inside of gun range, it will kill the TU-95 with a single burst 99.9% of the time. If the TU-95 sees the A-10 coming, it can out climb, out dive, and outrun the A-10 ""winning"" by staying alive. But it will never win a dogfight. Best it could hope for is a mutual destruction draw."

"argumenta sobre: Could Sheldon Cooper Produce 99.1% Pure Meth Like Walter White? Let's imagine a scenario where Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory is challenged to produce methamphetamine with the same 99.1% purity as Walter White from Breaking Bad. Sheldon has no prior experience in drug manufacturing but has a genius-level IQ, a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, and an eidetic memory. If given a reasonable time frame let's say a few months, could Sheldon learn enough about chemistry to match Walter White's 99.1% pure meth? Or does the lack of practical chemistry experience mean that no amount of theoretical knowledge would allow him to reach that level of purity? How do you think Sheldon would fare in this unconventional challenge?","No, if we're not talking about comedy universe rules and he pulls it off-screen for some reason. Reasons being: - Walt is a genius level chemist in his own right. Gale Boetticher was extremely good as well and had no idea how to pull it off. Jesse did it alongside Walter for 1.5 years and reached a ""mere"" 96% purity, when he went to Mexico. - Sheldon isn't a chemist at all. He works on a chalkboard most of the time and it concerns subatomic particles. Chemical engineering is not his field of expertise. To quote Mitch Hedberg: ""So, you're a great cook. Do you know how to farm?"" - Sheldon is very bad at reconsidering options when he's found a solution. If he devised a method that required a particle collider and a billion dollars per pound of 100% pure meth, he'd just sit down and say it's your fault for not providing that and therefore your problem. - Sheldon is often shown to be extremely inept and even has a childlike helplessness when it comes to practical things. For example, he can't figure out how to drive until way towards the end of the show. - finally he's a terrible team player and it is mentioned cooking blue meth is at least a two-man job."
"argumenta sobre: Guy who thinks he's a Jedi Vs Guy who thinks he's Jack Sparrow The guy who thinks he's a Jedi starts as a normal dude, but trains for 10 years to be a jedi. He trains himself in kenjutsu and wushu, and partakes in a lot of sparring with people of many different sword styles. To gain more experience, he takes part in the TSL championships every year. Also, he spends a lot of time practicing moves he sees in the Star Wars movies. A lot of his training revolves around meditation, and for physical training he goes for long runs in the forest with a yoda-size bag of rice tied to his back. He also does hand stands for long perioda of time while meditating. He also partakes in any other physical training applicable to his fighting styles. Through meditation and other forms of training, he has tried to train himself to stay calm at all times and have control of his emotions. His weapon is a Taijijian sword which has been made to look like a lightsaber the blade has even been made blue. Weaknesses: He truly thinks the force is real and may try to use it in battle. He may sometimes try to do things a jedi could do in the movies but he cannot. Finally, he believes in the Jedi way, and will try to avoid killing his opponents if possible. The guy who thinks he's Jack Sparrow starts as an average dude but trains for ten years to he a pirate. He'a spent that time training in pirate-style fencing fencing without rules, and has has done most of his fencing drills standing on narrow passages to work on his balance. A lot of his training has been sparring with advanced fencers. For physical training, he does things like lift and carry barrels from one place to another, along with other physical labor you'd expect on a pirate ship, and a lot of fencing drills. In a fight, he's willing to ""cheat"", such as throwing sand or rocks or anything else. His weapon is a cutlass which is an exact replica of Jack Sparrows. EDIT: NO GUN. READ PROMPT. JESUS. Weaknesses: He's perpetually a little drunk, and also thinks he has Jack Sparrow's supernatural luck. As such, sometimes he'll do things Jack Sparrow could normally luck his way out of, even though that's not how life works. R1: Fight takes place in an MMA octagon. Winner by death or surrender. R2: Fight takes place on an abandoned pirate ship. Winner by death or surrender.","Jedi training is more intense, so is probably in better physical shape, but not enough to do Jedi feats. Since he thinks he's a Jedi, he would probably kill himself by trying some insane acrobatics shit. As for Jack guy, his weakness is less severe and while his training is worse, it's still quite intense so he could probably pull of the win for R1. And for R2, since he thinks he's a pirate he would have a lot more knowledge of the layout and have a sort of home field advantage"

"argumenta sobre: One average human being vs All animals on earth scaled to human size, one at a time Okay so I've been wondering, since human beings lack claws, teeth, wings, hide, sharp senses, etc., are we not physically inferior to every other creature on earth? Even otherwise harmless creatures like ants or termites could rip us apart if they were our size. So the question is: can a human sized human take on any human sized animal? The person in question can be Joe Everyman, average build, average fitness. Joe fights only one creature at a time. Fatigue is not a factor, everything resets after a fight is over. The fight happens in an open arena, with both participants standing 10 metres apart at the beginning. For simplicity I'm only going to address land based creatures. Round 1: Joe faces off every creature on earth one at a time. No prep, no equipment, no weaponry. Is there even a single animal that Joe can beat? Round 2: Joe has now learnt martial combat, is in peak physical condition, and can choose a single melee weapon. Which animals still pose a threat? Round 3: Joe has mastered all human weaponry, and can choose any weapon provided it can be operated by a single person for the fight. No vehicles, so Joe can't just rock up in a M1 Abrams tank. He can also prepare for a day before each fight set traps, research weaknesses. Can any creature still take him down? EDIT: Okay so the rule is weight based, not size based. The average human male weighs between 150 and 200lb, or around 75kg. All animals are scaled up or down to the same weight. Also, yes I am ignoring certain physical and biological rules for the sake of the argument. Let's assume insects and other small creatures can survive being expanded in size. Suffocation, blood pressure, air pressure are all non-factors. A lot of people mentioned insects dominating the fight, which I agree with, but I think even something like a rabbit would be deadly if increased in size. Humans are built for endurance and durability, yes, but when it comes to speed and reflexes, most if not all animals have us beat. If anything, it would be the larger animals that'd be easier to beat cause they're scaled down. For example, a 75kg elephant would be tiny average elephant can weigh fifty times that. Also, I think primates and felines would be some of the top contenders, due to their speed and physical strength. A chimp can literally rip your arms out of their sockets even without being scaled up, while house cats can jump up to nine times their height, etc. I'm still unsure if any animal could win in R3. Insects, or maybe something like a rhino that has a protective hide? I can't think of any creature that survives an RPG to the face. The only animal I can think of that wins this is one that's fast enough to dodge Joe's weaponry and kill/incapacitate him first, like a cheetah or certain predator birds.","It depends if you define size by dimensions or mass. I'll assume mass. Round 1, ignoring the obvious wins like fish, most prey animals would just avoid fighting and you'd chase them to exhaustion, sheep, deer etc. Shout out to sloths who get battered. Round 2, very few animals at our weight could beat a trained human with a spear, even in the real world a human with a spear can kill almost all animals on his own, 50/50 vs a polar bear, probably loses to rhino's elephants and hippos although they'd probably just run away and you'd kill them when exhausted or chase them off a cliff. Throughout history teenagers have killed lions 1 on 1 with a spear as a right of passage. Scale them down and they have no chance. He might struggle vs scaled up insects spiders and things like mosquitos. Round 3,. Add in modern day weaponry and I don't think there's any animal that wins."

Each person binge-reads before the exams. Which person does the marginally better job?","I was going to say that there is no SAT science test, but the Subject Tests did exist in 1998, so you're good there.

"argumenta sobre: Who would have the biggest impact; A man with a billion dollars who wants to do as much good as possible vs A man with 1 million dollars who wants to do as much harm as possible? A benevolent billionaire vs A malevolent millionaire. Since destroying things is way easier than creating things, I figure I'd give the good guy more money than the bad guy. The rules are simple. Both men are determined to do the most good/evil and will absolutely use every last dollar of their funds to do so. Both men cannot stop each other from helping or hurting people directly as in killing each other personally or hiring a hitman to kill the other. But they can try and stop or rectify each other's actions as in bad guy blowing up a library good guy funded, or good guy funding a relief effort after one of bad guy's crimes. The bad guy cannot be caught and tried until he runs out of money. Who will have the biggest impact in the end?","I'd probably give it to the bad guy. If he, say, kills a lot of people, there's no way for the good guy to undo that. He can compensate the families, but I'd imagine that most people would rather have their loved ones back than any amount of money."

"argumenta sobre: Thanos is arrested for killing half of all life. Can Saul Goodman defend him in court? Instead of cutting his head off, The still-alive avengers at the start of Endgame arrest Thanos, and he is put on trial for the manslaughter of half of the human race. However, Thanos is given 1 lawyer out of mercy, and said laywer happens to be Saul Goodman. Saul is taught everything about Thanos's life and the events of Infinity War, and he has 3 weeks before the trail. Saul wins if Thanos is not given the death penalty. How well does he do?",Absolutely not. Solely because the major thing being missed here is that Thanos would absolutely admit he did it. He didn't seem to give a shit that he was almost certainly about to die on his garden planet; in fact he was basically gloating. He wouldn't feel the need to defend his actions because he'd be proud of them

THE MEN CANNOT TOUCH THE PROTEIN POWDER, AND CANNOT DO ANYTHING THAT MAY HARM STORE STAFF. This is to prevent cheap, uninteresting solutions. Also if you post please give a good explanation.",They can probably delay him for the day. But it would more rely on Morale. Can they make him uninterested in the purchase? Cap doesn't read websites and he knows they're planning on stopping him but if they can make a photoshop flyer of the store's hours being changed then maybe Cap gets delayed. If he is set on going to check trying to hurt him is a fools errant but misdirection is essential. Fuck with road signs. Mess traffic. America is not walker friendly so he'll have to go through some irritating environments. Even if he knows where the shop is they can just line up in the store as annoyingly incompetent guests. Thus preventing the sale.

DC/IRL Caesar Romero Joker, Jack Nicholson Joker, Heath Ledger Joker, Jared Leto Joker, Joaquin Phoenix Joker, and Cameron Monaghan Joker are all dropped into the real world. Which would cause the most trouble? The Jokers are dropped in different major cities all over the USA. They are the same as in their movie/show incarnations, but without the connections. Anything they could build or plan in their worlds, they can accomplish similar feats in ours, if it's not physically impossible, like Caesar Romero Joker doesn't get the human dehydrating machine from the Batman movie he was in.

"argumenta sobre: Who is the weakest character than can successfully prank Batman, plus make him laugh and admit that it was a 'good one'? DC Comics The Justice League is having a meeting without their dour mascot, Batman. The team thinks that Bruce needs to lighten up a bit. Since getting blasted through hell history by the Omega Sanction, going on Batman Odyssey, and fighting half a dozen evil versions of himself who wanted to eat the multiverse, the dude could really use a break. If he doesn't let himself have a good laugh or relax for a bit he's going to have an aneurism. The Justice League knows they can't just tell Batman this, he'd never go along with it, so the only real solution is a prank! No one can stay mad at a perfectly executed prank, right?! So, who is the weakest character in DC comics plus Wildstorm, Milestone, Watchmen, etc who could not only successfully pull a prank on Batman, but also make Bruce laugh at/with the prank and admit to the prankster that it was in fact 'a good one' or something similar. A small chuckle and nod of acknowledgement is acceptable, but does anyone get a full bodied guffaw out of the caped crusader? Edit! No Alfred! That guy is too OP! Alfred is frozen in carbonite during this arc or something.","Probably some random kid in gotham. Batman usually seems to have a lot more patience for children than he does adults, and after all nearly every incarnation of it sees him as someone who is pursuing justice due to a childhood tragedy. Makes sense that he'd want children to feel comfortable and safe around him. I bet a little cuteness from some kid, like a harmless prank, would be a welcome sight for the caped crusader indeed."

Lasts for a decade.","OK, this is actually pretty bad. There were \62 million deaths in all of 2023, and there are \32 million seconds in a year. So this would substantially increase the death rate. It wouldn't be a true 50% increase, since some of those 32 million would have fallen into the 62 million that would have happened without the curse, but it's a substantial number. The UN currently estimates that there are 316,000 centenarians worldwide, so within half a week there'd be nobody over the age of 100. This probably isn't enough to immediately start shrinking world population, but it would represent a substantial increase in the death rate."

Resources are scarce and the humans are losing the battle, but there is hope. Bruce Wayne is holed up in LA with a tortoise. In this tortoise's veins flow the key to developing a zombie vaccine. However, the scientists who can develop the vaccine are in New York City, and the reagents needed to create the medicine have a shelf life of 2 more years. ​ Can the Dark Knight save humanity by guiding this tortoise across the country in 2 years? ​ The rules: \-The tortoise is a full grown and healthy male Galapagos tortoise, weighing 500 pounds. It will need to be fed and taken care of like any other tortoise. Batman also needs to feed himself, find water, etc. \-The zombies act like most movie zombies, but they want to bite the tortoise as well. They can be knocked out temporarily, or killed by destroying the head/decapitating. \-Gas-based vehicles cars, planes, motorbikes, ships are out of fuel and can't be used. \-If the tortoise gets bitten by a zombie, game over. \-If Batman gets bitten, he becomes a zombie within 48 hours. \-The tortoise understands the situation, wants to get to NYC, and will mostly obey Bruce Wayne's commands, but is otherwise limited to tortoise-like skills. \-Bruce Wayne starts with a fully equipped batsuit, but with no refills to weapons. \-The tortoise cannot be fitted with armor or protective gear of any kind. ​ Round 1: Normal, slow zombies. Easy to incapacitate. Round 2: 28 days later zombies. Fast, harder to incapacitate.

Heavily reinforced by Primaris and implied to no longer strictly follow the 1000 Marine limit. They are commanded not only by Calgar but also the G-Man himself. While your average marine is going to lack the shields of a Spartan, their armor, weapons, and all other assets are superior. Not to mention they are quantifiably stronger, faster, and just overall better. In space the numbers of covenant ships would pose the biggest problem however the 40K ships have such a huge advantage that I don't think it is going to really be a problem. FTL speeds are going to the the only real advantage the covenant has, and that isn't as useful when we are talking about fighting in a gravity well.

"argumenta sobre: Can Ben 10 scan Superman with the Omnitrix, turn into a Kryptonian and BEAT Superman? As the title says, Ben 10 can become any alien species aside from Human and Anodite since he already possesses those DNA therefore he can become a Kryptonian. And we know the omnitrix uses is connected to a kind of biological hivemind that connects all life even across the multiverse therefore Ben 10 always becomes the Peak performance of the Alien Race he becomes with fully unlocked capabilities stretching through that particular species' entire history. Basically Ben 10 should turn into the Krytonian version of like Batman or Captain America, a peak human bordering on Superhuman but for Krytonians. Can Superman defeat Ben 10 as a Peak Kryptonian? Edit: As a bonus, can we replace Superman with Goku?","So assuming he does it right in front of Superman and then tries to fight him, no. Superman gains his powers by absorbing solar radiation but this is a process that takes time for example, how he was powerless for some time after expending all of his energy with Super Flare. Even if Ben turned into a Kryptonian, he doesn't INSTANTLY suck up enough solar radiation to match Superman. If Ben turned Kryptonian and then left the fight, having time to absorb the powers, maybe. But if Superman figured out what was going on he is pretty smart himself , he'd probably just destroy the Omnitrix. Of course Ben can probably beat Superman with Alien X anyway. As for Goku, no. Goku's strength isn't just from being a Saiyan. It comes from years of martial arts training under multiple different teachers, numerous power boosts from nearly dying/actually dying multiple times, and divine ki. Ben might become a Saiyan but he wouldn't have Super Saiyan God, Super Saiyan Blue, Kaio-Ken, or Ultra Instinct. I'd honestly call a peak Saiyan like.. Saiyan Saga Vegeta. Again though, Alien X probably beats Goku."

They're also shockingly fast like any cat, claws that could disembowel you, and strong enough to break your neck with one swing. Jon has no training with real medieval weaponry, so barring a quick lucky stab with a spear or knife, that tiger is going to bury him with a leap, then those jaws will go to work. Once they clamp down, it's game over. Now he could land a lucky stab or slash, but odds are the wound will be superficial. This is why he needs a gun."

Edit: the weather is sunny, but it's windy.","Well this is kind of tough in R3 looking at the sub styles of each Water Ice - This sub bending is the most common and could be used for quick crowd control. Plant - Intimidating at first, but nothing useful, maybe for binding a bender. Cloud - Camouflage, if they were far away and had to find each other this would be useful as a fog layer can hide the bender. Mud - Mess with footing, but not to useful all around. Blood - OP but it only works under a Full Moon as the one bloodline that could do it willy nilly died off, it is also implied to have psychological damage as a side effect so beware. Earth Sand - Very similar to air or water bending except its not wet, could be used to trap or bury foes. Mud - Same as water's Metal - Very powerful, any weapon or armor is now a liability, hard counters combustion benders by turning them into a bomb. Lava - Stupidly OP, scorched earth method of fighting, from the 2 Lava Benders we've seen though, you can't bend lava and metal as they require different dispositions to handle. Fire Lightning - Quick and deadly, makes regular Waterbending a very dangerous gambit, very powerful even if you miss, but easy to disrupt since it requires focus. Combustion - Another powerful style, Fire bending makes up for the lack of styles by having them be powerful. Ever shot is a missile, but you have easily telegraphed weak points and your super power is also your weakness, you can easily blow yourself up if you are not careful. Air Astral - Sort of useless as your body is still there doing nothing, I guess you could win by being a spirit forever waiting on the other 3 to die of old age Flight - Even a master can't do this, it requires detachment, and someone in this 4-way fight is probably attached to something.

The loop will reset if he dies, or if the day ends without him killing Bruce. Round 1: Batman does not know that someone is coming to kill him.

"argumenta sobre: Middle Earth LOTR VS the Zombie Apocalypse Walking Dead. Who survives? The entirety of Middle Earth is infected by the virus from the Walking Dead. Rules: - The infection affects Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Orcs, and Trolls. Upon dying, all of these will turn into a Walker zombie bent on devouring the flesh of any living being. - Being bitten by a zombie will result in the victim turning into a zombie anywhere between a few minutes to 8 hours. - There is no cure and none can be created. Athelas, Elven magic and dark sorcery might slow it down, but undeath is inevitable. - Animals and Ents are immune to the infection. Both will still be targeted by Zombies. - Maiar Sauron, Gandalf, Saruman, etc, the Nazgûl, and other supernatural beings are immune to infection but can still die from zombie attacks if in physical form. - Zombies cannot be controlled by any supernatural means, so Sauron can't bend them to his will. - There will be no divine intervention from the Valar or Ilúvatar. Middle Earth is on its own. Middle Earth will also have to face starvation, infighting, and even wars for resources as Kingdom by Kingdom they dwindle. Supernatural means can still be used to keep lands safe or hidden, but resources may dwindle eventually. No one is aware of the infection until it begins spreading. Which Kingdoms can survive for a minimum of 10 years? Which Kingdoms can survive indefinitely? Bonus: Which characters can survive the apocalypse indefinitely? Book or Movie versions. Round 1: Scenario begins immediately after Frodo receives the One Ring. Round 2: Scenario begins immediately before the Council of Elrond begins.

Round 4: Scenario begins a day before Sauron's armies begin their attack on Gondor.","If it is the walking dead zombies, I believe that it would be a short lasting spread.

"argumenta sobre: Kevin McCallister Home Alone is now a youngling in the Jedi temple during Revenge of the Sith. Can he beat Anakin? Kevin, protagonist of Home Alone, is now a Jedi Youngling with the appropriate level of training for his age. He is reasonably talented but not some sort of force genius. The moment all the adults in the temple are out of reach, Kevin intuits, via the Force, that Anakin has betrayed them and is coming to kill everyone. Can he set up traps capable of stopping the future Darth Vader? Kevin has been putting together partial, incomplete traps for the past year just for fun, without knowing what it is for and rapidly puts them all into effect when he realizes he needs to stop Anakin. Assume that Kevin is favored by many Jedi and extremely resourceful and was therefore able to obtain anything a Jedi could plausibly give him to use for his traps. Kevin himself cannot flee the temple. He must either kill Anakin or incapacitate him in some lasting fashion. If Anakin's precognitive abilities and danger sense make this a stomp, assume that all of Kevin's traps contain some sort of special material or cloaking field that prevents them from being predicted by the Force, or that Kevin has some sort of unique force ability that makes it impossible to predict traps he set up using the force. Anakin can use his speed or other abilities to try and escape them, but will receive no precognitive warnings about them whatsoever and is unable to search for them using the Force even once he knows they're there. In all rounds, there are no Jedi Masters or adults in the temple even after Anakin enters, of course. Anakin will not receive, and cannot draw on, any outside help whatsoever - he has his standard gear and nothing else.","I can't find it now, but I recommend looking up the Star wars knights of the old republic's HK-47s dialogue about how to kill jedi its on YouTube in its entirety. His explanations definitely aid Kevin's cause here. By the use of traps such as mines and tripwires things that are not detected by the force normally a jedi can be killed. I'm guessing there's sufficient material on hand that Kevin could lay enough potentially lethal traps that he stands a chance vs anakin."

"argumenta sobre: Could the Killdozer destroy the Berlin Wall? In 2004, Marvin Heemeyer modified a used Komatsu D355A bulldozer with steel and concrete armor and cameras for external visibility also covered by bulletproof clear lexan. The dozer had three gunports and Heemeyer had a .50, a .308, and a .22 caliber rifle, along with multiple handguns in the cabin with him. The dozer was also stocked with enough food and water for a week. Throughout a two hour rampage during which he demolished 13 buildings, police fired 200 rounds and targeted the killdozer with multiple explosives which had no effect whatsoever, and Heemeyer was only stopped after he drove the dozer into a basement and got stuck. Instead of Granby Colorado, Heemeyer and his killdozer are transported to East Germany in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Can he successfully destroy the wall's defenses and allow East German citizens to escape freely to the West?","No, lol. If the Soviets sat back and did nothing the Killdozer would be destroyed by a landmine, or just get stuck.

However when you actually watch the fighting scenes, he just slowly bobs around the ring just soaking up massive haymakers.

argumenta sobre: could europe beat a modern USSR? By modern USSR. I mean that every single country who was in the USSR at any point merges back again and is happy about it alongside the populace. And everything in those countries become their russian equivalents. Air defence systems become the S400 tanks become the T90 tanks. Different types of aircraft and land vehicles become the closest match to them in the russian inventory. Can this modern USSR beat europe?besides the parts they now have thanks to reunification,"The combined air power of France/UK/Germany/Italy/Spain/Greece feels like it would be too much to overcome. There are other Euros with smaller air forces, but are already operating F35s. Russia was unable to achieve air superiority over Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion, and has since lost a lot of their fleet. The raw numbers you'll see of purported military aircraft don't mean much if they are outdated or in disrepair. As someone already mentioned, an actual invasion by Europe would be an extremely long, drawn out defensive war. But with their air power they could mostly cripple any offensive capabilities."

Some of the phones will be given to government officials, while the remaining 60% will be sold to the general public for $5.

It also benefits Germany in their defence against strategic destruction doctrine as they can have scout planes over the coasts watching for incoming bombers and instantly call back to their bases for interception. The war gets prolonged by years but the allies will still win eventually since American industry can't be touched and allied naval superiority will always protect Britain.

Site-81's Provisional Division, in collaboration with FCC CU-9, has been tasked with priority-level tracking, intercept protocols, and offensive neutralization procedures. As of Incident 666.23.∆ see Addendum IV, SCP-666-TRK must be destroyed by any means necessary. Operation ""Final Crossing"" has been greenlit by O5 Command and FCC Directive 99-A, allowing for use of nuclear, conceptual, and ontokinetic ordinance. Any mention of The Punisher.mp4, a cognitohazardous video file linked to SCP-666-TRK, must be immediately reported. Personnel exposed to the file are to be quarantined, cognitively scrubbed, and administered Class-VII amnestics. No footage involving Route 23 pile-up survivors is to be archived digitally. Description: SCP-666-TRK is a 1970 Kenworth 849/LW924 logging truck with no verifiable origin. It was transferred to SCP Foundation custody by the Fictional Character Control Agency FCC after the object, originally classified as a ""Fictional Object FO-849-B,"" exhibited sentient and recursive narrative control capabilities. It self-identified in documents as ""The Punisher"", though this name is not official Foundation designation. SCP-666-TRK bears no affiliation with any real or fictional logging company, although faded references to ""Tagert Logging"" were once visible on its frame. These markings have since been overwritten by crude glyphs, demonic sigils, and the numerals ""666"" burned into the steel bodywork. These alterations appear organic upon inspection, composed of carbonized flesh and bone fragments. Under the vehicle's front grill is a retractable, fleshy mouth cavity. The jaw mechanism is made of fused rib-bone structures and sinew, only manifesting when SCP-666-TRK is active. It emits guttural noises consistent with low-frequency vocalizations. The flatbed contains seventeen 17 red spruce logs Picea rubens, designated SCP-666-TRK-1 through -17. DNA testing confirms the organic matter originated from terrestrial red spruce trees, but the entities exhibit complete neurological and muscular autonomy. When unshackled or during ""chain failure"" events, the logs are capable of bouncing and rolling toward targets with force sufficient to crush reinforced concrete or bisect human torsos. Once a target is terminated, they autonomously return to the flatbed, reattaching their chains via unknown mechanisms. Chain breakage is always temporary. SCP-666-TRK is sapient and hostile. Its target priorities have been narrowed to three entities: Kimberly Corman Final Destination Survivor Officer Thomas Burke Final Destination Survivor Death designated Anomaly DE-000, see Addendum V SCP-666-TRK is believed to be attempting to infiltrate purgatorial dimensions in order to enact long-term psychological and metaphysical torture on its targets.

In this version: The log truck, car carrier truck SCP-666-TRK-B, and garbage truck SCP-666-TRK-C appear distorted, shrouded in static and flickering red sigils. Survivors Kimberly Corman and Thomas Burke are shown bound in purgatorial loops, perpetually reliving their deaths across increasingly twisted scenarios. The file ends post-credits with a grainy still: The three trucks idling side-by-side in a desolate truck stop. Each slowly turns their front toward the camera. Text appears on-screen: ""We are coming for the traitors. We are coming for Death. We do not stop. We remember."" Following this screen, a distorted scream resembling Kimberly Corman's voice plays in reverse for 66 seconds. All attempts to delete or scrub the file have failed. Even when removed from storage, it reappears in digital repositories. Addendum III: Beginning Report – May 13, 2001 Event: Route 23 Pile-Up Summary: At 08:43 EST, SCP-666-TRK engaged in a high-speed, autonomous drive down Route 23. The object's chains failed, releasing SCP-666-TRK-1 through -17, resulting in mass casualties. A small fuel tank mounted under the trailer was struck by an unknown vehicle, triggering an explosion and damaging SCP-666-TRK's rear chassis. The logs, despite being scattered, were later seen back in formation on the truck, with no mechanical tools involved. The truck, alongside SCP-666-TRK-B ""Truck from Hell"" and SCP-666-TRK-C ""The Garbage Eater"", disappeared down the left lane of the highway, despite no survivors confirming the trucks were present after the crash. Addendum IV: DNA & Anomalous Structure Analysis Subject: SCP-666-TRK-1 through -17 Red Spruce Logs Result: Tree rings show impossible growth patterns—doubling back, forming runes. Tissue contains nerve-like filaments and responds to electric stimulation. Cellular structure is fused with iron fragments, matching chain components. All logs respond to the truck's ignition—even when separated by kilometers. When interviewed via a direct neurological interface, SCP-666-TRK-3 stated: ""We are his fingers. We reach. We fall.

Qui Gon has told the Jedi Council about being attacked by Darth Maul on Tatooine. But rather than saying ""take this small child into a war zone and see if the bad guy comes back"", the Council decide to enlist detective extraordinaire L to unravel the Sith's evil plans. Can L determine that Palpatine is Darth Sidious and stop him before Order 66 is given and the Jedi are wiped out? L does not have any force powers, but does have the full support of the Jedi and access to their information archives. R1: Palpatine is unaware of L's investigation and proceeds with his prequels plot as normal. R2: Palpatine is aware of L but unable to simply assassinate him from a distance with the force because the Jedi are protecting him.","R1: L will be murdered by Darth Maul. Palpatine would foresee or just ""feel"" L's actions and kill him in advance. Without any Jedi protection, there is nothing that would stop Maul or Sidious. R2: Unless the strongest and most efficient Jedi are specifically tasked with watching L all the time then Palpatine still wins. If the Jedi protect L like the cheat character he is then L will be able to prove Sidious=Palpatine sooner or later."
"argumenta sobre: Person is blessed with the abilities/feats of all insects on earth scaled to human size. Whose the most powerful character they can kill?

Cockroaches can run 50 body lengths a second. Bombardier beetle can spray toxic chemicals etc","He or she could definitely take down mid tier heroes like Spider-Man, midnighter, wolverine and black canary through using superior physicality.

"argumenta sobre: A man is sent to the year 1995, can he stop 9/11? He has exactly 6 years to stop 9/11, he doesn't need to worry about food or where he would live, just stopping 9/11. He has $100,000 in cash. Round One: He is sent with the knowledge of the average man Round Two: He is given 1 hour to research the topic before he is sent back in time","Here's a completely different idea... Start a cult / militia group / something full of somewhat crazy people, and persuade them of the truth of the attack and have them learn hand to hand fighting. Covertly. Then have them go on every plane the terrorists go on, at the same time, ideally in seats near the front, and when the terrorists come, fight them. It's crazy and there's a good chance of failure e.g. if the government notices him and it probably messes up American culture at least as badly as 9/11 by glorifying said cult, but it bypasses all that inconvenient disbelief. This should work in both rounds because one hour is enough to learn which specific flights were jacked. It does assume the man is charismatic enough to pull it off."
"argumenta sobre: One 16-man SEAL team holding the narrow pass at Thermopyle against the Persian hordes. The SEAL team has personal weapons only, but unlimited bullets and grenades and rations stored in the pass, and time to dig in using only personal trenching tools. Is Greece safe? And/Or: one 16-man SEAL team assaulting 300 Spartans who are defending the narrow pass at Thermopyle and have had time to dig in. The SEAL team has only personal weapons and only as much ammo and equipment as they can carry and no night vision. Do they invade Greece? See my comment for detailed rules which I think produce the most even match-ups possible. Night vision is allowed for SEAL defenders, but not SEAL attackers.","Would the Persians be aware of these weapons? Because if you just place 16 Seals with their weapons back in time to fight a battle like this, the other side would probably believe they're fighting some God or divine entity and retreat after the first few columns of soldiers just start dropping."
"argumenta sobre: What's the weakest creature that could prey on xenomorphs? Xenomorphs are tough but not impossible to kill.

"argumenta sobre: A man gets all the 'powers' of the best cameras, e.g. super speed and super reflexes from slow-mo. How does Camera-Dude fare against the following universes? A IRL peak human in his late-twenties receives the powers of the best cameras in the world. What does this mean? Super speed and super reflexes as well as any secondary abilities to protect him: scaled to the best slow-mo camera in the world. For example, if the best slow-mo camera can capture things at 900,000 fps, he can move around 30,000x faster than a real-life peak human. 'Photographic' memory: can take mental snapshots with his mind for perfect recall, in addition to just normal memorization and such. Limit is the best storage used for a camera. Enhanced, multiple-purpose vision: his vision is far superior and capable of all camera functions, i.e. zoom, enhance etc. Night vision also included. Enhanced durability: not much compared to his other powers, but Camera-Dude is somewhat tougher -- unless I am wrong -- than peak human. He has the durability of IRL peak human + toughest camera. This is separate from his secondary speedster durability. And any other camera-related abilities at their highest present-day capabilities How does Camera-Dude fare against the multiverse? Can he conquer them, or at least beat their head honchos? Assume that he has basic combat abilities and knowledge of the universes.

So the guy is 18 years old, 6'1 ft 1,85 m tall, and weights around 165 lbs being fit. He plays football since he was a child, developed solid game knowledge, and plays for an amateur team of his hometown. However, he's not exceptionally talented. He has 2 years of preparation with his new power, and 5 years after that to squeeze himself into the pitch representing a world famous club - Real Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, the top dogs of the football stage in general. The position he always played before he gained powers is of your choosing as well. Can he do it without being caught using the powers? If so, which position he'll benefit the most with TK?","I would say yes, if he is smart. I would actually see him as some sort of attacking midfielder, so he can do the magic in situations which are confusing anyway. He can't play at the World Cup though.

R3: Seeing how Eren fights in AOT, close match, but favouring Eren due to actual skills and reactions difference to normal 'primal instinct' titans.

"argumenta sobre: 100 Hungry Hungry Hippos versus the Sun. 100 Immortal Hungry Hungry Hippos versus our Sun. Could they eat it before it goes supernova, assuming they literally never take a shit and they magically have no mass no matter how much they eat. The more they eat, the less the total mass of the sun and the longer it will take to go supernova if it even could at all. Followup question: if they couldn't, how many hungry hungry hippos would it take? My guess is it would take a lot more hungry hungry hippos than that. Assume we have 5 billion years before supernova at the current point. I have no idea how much sun a hungry hungry hippo could eat in a year but lets assume that a hungry hungry hippo eats one million times by mass whatever a regular hippo eats, by mass, per year.

Smaug had not paid tax on ANY of it. In how much trouble does that put him?",R1: IRS stomps. R2: If he fights it in court he has a decent chance of winning.

Why SpaceGodzilla is so powerful Tanked multiple hits from Heisei Godzilla, who can destroy islands and survive black hole-like gravity attacks.

Has gravity beams that cut through city blocks. Can terraform large zones and even regenerate from serious damage. Even in the Godzilla universe, he's considered kaiju royalty-tier in raw destructive ability and durability. 50,000 Tyranids – What's In the Force? At this number, you're not just fielding Gaunts and Warriors. You're deploying: Multiple Hive Tyrants, Maleceptors, and Neurothropes for psychic bombardment. Dozens of Carnifexes, Trygons, Tyrannofexes, and even a few Barbed Hierodules or Scythed Hierodules. Exocrines and Biovores to bombard from long range. Tens of thousands of Gaunts and Genestealers to overwhelm by sheer mass. A fully coordinated Synapse network, making the swarm disciplined, fast, and nearly fearless. Warp-based attacks from Zoanthropes that can bypass conventional durability. This isn't a swarm anymore. It's a continental extinction-level event.","Could go ether way. I don't know as much about the tyranids, but any Godzillaaside Ultima I guess usually requires bits and pieces of Information scattered everywhere to get a scale of how powerful they are.

There are 363 days to prep. The gifts must be delivered on Christmas Eve. Presents must be within 100 feet of their target's home.

You said this: >Eminem is composite Eminem so he gets all his real life feats plus his self-described / fictional feats from his songs, music videos, and 8 mile. Zoom in: >plus his self-described / fictional feats from his songs Eminem is omnipotent, he holds the secret to rap immortality, he can literally burst into flame and survive, Dr. Dre says ""Hell yeah!"" to his raps while people his opponent addressed as ""you"" in the song gets a thumbs up and pat on the back, automatically meaning his opponent's raps are nowhere near as good, and refers to himself as Odin.

"argumenta sobre: WW2: Nazi Germany with respawning soldiers vs the Soviet Union How would these two powers match against each other if the Nazis had a re-spawning system in place for their soldiers? This ability would have several ground rules; 1. Every German soldier that dies in combat respawns at the nearest German Army Base 2. The respawn ability is only limited to 1 time per soldier. This means that the ´respawned´ soldiers cannot respawn again, as they have already used the one-time respawn ability. 3. The soldier respawns with all their equipment/weaponry intact, also removing their previous equipment from the battlefield. 4. If larger units get wiped out together ie. a German tank & whole the crew gets taken out at the same time, they respawn with their tanks intact aswell. Of course this assumes that all the soldiers in the tank have their one-time ´respawn´ ability ready. 5. German High command are aware of this ability, and can plan their military tactics/strategies accordingly. Meanwhile the Soviets remain completely unaware of this at all times. Suppose Operation Barbarossa starts as usual in June 1941, but Germany can solely focus on it, without France/the UK/the US to worry about. R1: Aforementioned rules; zero outside interference, just Germany and the USSR. R2: Soviet Union gets the Lend Lease program help from the US. Italy helps Germany. Also the German soldiers now have 2 respawns per soldier. R3: Same as round 2 but the German soldiers are now bloodlusted.","Round 1: Germany can defeat the USSR one on one even without respawning soldiers. Even in 1941 Germany devoted a massive amount of military and economic resources to fighting Britain and it would likely tip the scales in the war against the USSR if Britain and the US was no longer a concern. Round 2: Germany wins. Having essentially double the manpower the Heer attacked the USSR with 3 million troops and suffered around 200,000 deaths during Barbarossa means heavier Soviet losses and Moscow and Leningrad are almost certainly taken in 1941. Round 3: Germany wins."

The official crossing attempts include a nearby support crew in a boat to provide things like water, food, medical attention - and the boat itself provides directional guidance and shelter from the wind and worst of the waves. It's likely that few-to-none of the successful participants could do it without any support at all."
"argumenta sobre: One trained knight, fully armored, w one melee weapon of his choice, VS, An Enraged Silverback Gorilla So I was thinking about the 100 men vs Gorilla thing, and, I had a thought, one armed man is way more interesting. I feel like the armor and weapon give him a fighting chance, but, it's probably not decidedly a victory in one way or the other. Can a gorilla's bite break or pierce the armor? I don't know, probably, would a pike, or Halberd, keep the gorilla at bay? Maybe. I think it's more interesting, and I'd love to know other people's thoughts on this one.",Pointy stick beats everything. Unless it doesn't. Then you just need friends with pointy sticks.
argumenta sobre: Godzilla vs. A Godzilla sized Mike Tyson This is Monsterverse Godzilla Mike Tyson can still move as fast as he normally can but scaled up to his size and he knows of Godzilla's atomic breath Both are bloodlusted. Who will win Kill or incapacitate to win Takes place in Tokyo Edit: Mike is armed with a metal baseball bat and spiked titanium knuckles like brass knuckles but titanium,"Mike has a better chance than Kong, but loses for the same reasons, fire bad, hard skin. Edit: Alright, people seem to underestimate Godzillas speed, we've more than seen Godzilla move at proportionally human speeds, so lemme end this shit rn Let's be generous to Tyson and assume Godzilla's flesh is proportional to his size to a crocodile. You have 3.5 feet of diamond-dense plating. Let's take the average boxer punch force of 6k newtons, multiply it by 1.5, because Mike Tyson, and multiply it by fifty for his size and we have 450k newtons per square meter being exerted by Tyson. That's 244.44k times less than needed to displace, let alone break Godzillas skin being generous. A punch from Tyson won't do much here. So Godzilla takes durability, and the fact let alone that Godzilla can move himself, still fight a big monke, and win gives him strength, so Godzilla has strength and durability but Tyson takes speed and intelligence. Our tiebreaker is ""Tyson can't blow up with the force of a hydrogen bomb at will and survive""."

Can Napoleon successfully conquer Westeros and become Emperor of the Seven Kingdoms?","Napoleon has muskets, cannons and mortars; they would obliterate any force raised against them, including the dragons. Westeros' only hope is that Napoleon wouldn't believe or expect dragons to actually fly and not have artillery aimed upwards and waiting, AND that they can fly well enough to not get shot down once the artillery asjusted. Because cannons could totally kill the dragons, it's all a matter of how good the artillerymen's aim is.

The unnamed rando Troopers in The Rise of Skywalker have jetpacks and grenade launchers built into their blasters. The shock baton thing from VII seems pretty cool too. A normal ass Storm Trooper was able to give Finn the business even when he had a lightsaber. Clone Troopers should be generally physically superior, and they seemingly have better indoctrination/training. First Order Troopers have better equipment and solid training but also a lot of deserters. Clones have more wins on screen mostly because they're in more media, but First Order folks honestly aren't too shabby. They both smoke Imperial Storm Troopers from the original trilogy. Clones probably have a bit of an edge, but not nearly as much as some people are making it out to be. I think Clones take it 6/10, but it depends on the loadout and on the specific troops fighting. TR-8R beats anyone but special named Clones in melee. Baseline 1v1 they're about even, but counterintuitively the Clones have more unique characters with sick feats to tip the scale."

Geralt on the other hand has a rulebook sure but will stop at nothing to win including dirty tricks or morally dubious tactics. Also, that damn magic.

Round 1: hand to hand combat. Pilots have full use of jump kits but not additional equipment: Halo Spartan has standard armor functionality and Halo 5 thrusters: this is changed in later rounds. Arena is an empty cube room 12 ft by 12 ft by 12 feet Round 2: Standard Loudouts. Pilot is given R-200 rifle: Spartan is given Halo Reach Assault Rifle and Two Plasma Grenades, but no thrusters.

Who wins, and by how much, and why?","I can't wait for each subsequent fandom to stroll in here and wank their characters until they pass out. Personally I'm just gonna take round 4. I'd say master chief would win at golf. Doomslayer hits his ball into a sand pit and throws his club into the stratosphere, so hes out. Inviting what's basically a living ball of rage in human form to a sport that requires patience and calmness isn't a great idea. Arbiter and Cooper aren't pushovers but I think Chief just has an edge on the both of them. After all his main thing is that hes Mr Lucky. Luck seems like a good thing to have in golf."

argumenta sobre: Conquest Invincible vs Regulus Rezero Round 1: no prep time Round 2: 24 hours of prep time Round 3: bloodlusted and enraged,"If Regulus has his wives, he sweeps all three rounds. If he doesn't have any wives, which should be the case due to this being a solo battle, Conquest should have no issue tanking the initial hits from Regulus. Even if he obliterated a limb, that wouldn't meaningfully stop Conquest from continuing the fight,from there, he would be able to dodge strikes from Regulus until his 5 second clock runs out and end the fight immediately. Ultimately, Conquest has reaction speeds that completely outstrip anything Regulus is capable of, and the Viltrumite has thousands of years of combat experience. Unless Regulus gets a lethal blow in very early, I think Conquest wins this 7/10 times."

Elephants are five ton living tanks that can run pretty damn fast, have plenty of experiences trying to trample things smaller than they are, have even bigger tusks, and compared to walruses they're utter geniuses.Those polar bears are absolutely cooked if they try to hunt down an elephant and forcing the issue if the elephant's posturing doesn't get them to back down.

First and foremost, I'm not black as I am brown and Mexican. I can't speak for the hardships that black people must face on a day to day basis, but I can speak on what I've seen and experience as someone who has lived with black people in their lives. I've lived in Los Angeles, California, all my life. I've been here for pretty much all 23 years of my life and I've lived in the city of Compton for the majority of that time. I still live in Compton and I can tell you that I am not well-off and have been struggling even worse due to COVID-19. Most of my friends are those you would find in LA and Compton specifically, black people and Hispanics. I've seen the difference in treatment between my friends and neighbors just because of the color of our skin. I've been stopped by the police just because my friend was black and ""a potential suspect"" that needed to be questioned. I've sadly gone to a few funerals of black friends and their family members after such altercations went bad. The color of their skin was just as much a target on their backs that they had to live with 24/7. Many of us are so privileged to not understand an ounce of that danger black people live in, and you know what? That's great that you've never have had to live such a life. However I have a question for you, don't we all deserve that privilege? Shouldn't we all be able to live such peaceful lives where when getting pulled over by the cops we don't have to fear it may be our last hour on this Earth? Shouldn't we all have to live without telling our children how they must behave around cops in order to not be assumed a suspect? Shouldn't Philando Castile's daughter not have had to warn her mother that their cries could grab the attention of her and kill her next? All lives matter, they truly do. Every life is precious and full of so much potential to be great. But how can all lives matter if black lives don't matter? All lives can't matter if black lives don't matter as well. We cry for equality yet we deny that equality to our brothers and sisters of darker skin just because of their skin. You can replace property, you can rebuild a building, but you can't replace a life. George Floyd is dead and he's not coming back. Those buildings that have burned down and those items looted can be rebuilt and replaced respectively, but George is still going to be dead. If your initial thoughts to the current events of the world are riots and property damage then you're completely ignoring the point. These are occurring because of the injustice black lives face. Riots are what got people their rights, unions, freedom, and votes. Riots are what built this country. Racism is not and will never be tolerated on . Making light of the current events is not and will not be tolerated on . If you need to ask ""well what classifies as racism to the mods?"" Click that unsubscibe button. Racism is racism, there is no other definition. If you see this thread and think, ""Ugh, the mods are getting political here too?"" Fuck you. Denouncing racism and calling for the support of our black siblings is not political. Asking for equality is not political. For my final thoughts, if you are able to donate, please do so. I understand some people can not afford to donate, and that's perfectly fine as I am in a similar boat as I mentioned above. Please do spread the message though when you are able to. If you are able to vote, please go out and vote this November. Let your voice be head, be the change you want to see in this world. Black Lives Matter."

"argumenta sobre: Who would be more of a threat? Dementors or Nazgûl? Not really a vs, but who would be more threatening? Assuming the wizard is about Harry's power level during OotP. Edit: my reasoning behind this question is primarily this. A patronus keeps the dementors at bay and - in certain cases - banishes them. When the Nazgûl were pursuing Frodo, they were frightened by Glorfindel due to the radiance of his soul. Would this mean that the Nazgûl are equally affected by the Patronus or would they be more of a threat because even the patronus can't help.","The dementors are zero threat to Harry in order of the Phoenix. As seen by his very easy use of the charm that specifically counters them. Like his best move is fucking up dementors. In the third book he holds off dozens of them. The only reason he doesn't blast them immediately at the beginning of the book/movie is because he's not suppose to use magic in front of people. So all the wraiths have to do is be more of a threat than not a threat. Which I believe they are. Now how much so is up for debate but, at the very least they could throw a dagger at Harry or stab him both things he is unfortunately susceptible to. They also don't warn you by freezing the air and clouding the sky before they attack, it's possible they sneak up on him, they're stealthy former dudes. So if this nameless wizard with Harry potters power level is able to the charm and as well as Harry; I'd say Nazgul, simply because Harry specifically kicks dementor ass If for some reason that power doesn't equate to this wizard then I'd still lean Nazgul because they don't announce their attacks and the wizard would be completely unfamiliar with them. However. You can easily dispatch Nazgul with a good amount of fire, which a wizard at Harry's level should be able to produce. And Dementors are specifically used as prison guards for the worlds nastiest wizards. So only by the slightest margin would I consider Nazgul a worse threat."
argumenta sobre: Necrons vs Borg Star trek Borg vs 40k necrons,"Borgs are far to flawed to not be beaten by the Necrons. Necrons are not incompetent and they are far more creative when it comes to coming up with crazy technological feats on their own. Star Trek also has some crazy stuff into it. But the scaling alone is very, very different from Warhammer 40K, where even a small skirmish would surpass any conflict that happened in Star Trek. Star Trek Borgs got treated really badly, from a serious threat to a really 'meh' one. They were much more menacing at the beginning but got toned down a lot. Putting a queen in charge is just asking to exploit this weakness and simple stuff can destroy their collective. The necrons probably have more problems which way they choose to destroy them than actually destroying them."

"argumenta sobre: Character that is NOT from DC or Marvel or anything internationally popular in a who would win. I'm from Malaysia so I thought I'd take a character from my country and put him here for a battle. So there's this character in my country called Boboiboy. He's your average teenage superhero except imagine avatar + ben 10 + clonejutsu Boboiboy's powers and abilities: Has a watch that gives him elemental powers His watch can provide him elements from his surroundings though it takes a days to weeks for the watch to be able to analyze and give Boboiboy the powers Example: He stays at a magma planet and he gets the ability to control fire. He doesn't control his powers alone but he splits into multiples of himself with each using a different element and having different minds/their thoughts and actions can't be controlled by Boboiboy but he can undo the ""clone jutsu"" His elements upgrade and become stronger overtime. His elements include: Fire > Blaze Fire is well fire but with blaze he can create a giant meteor and send it down on his enemies Water > Ice Water can create miniature tsunamis and waterbend and ice can create massive ice mountains to freeze enemies and can create working weapons out of ice like a machine gun ice cannon lmao Lightning > Thunder I know lightning is the jolt of electricitt and thunder is the sound lightning makes but apparently in this show thunder is just lightning but faster and stronger Earth Basic Earth bending > Earthquake Can basically cause earthquakes and create things out of rock such as golems or fists the size of buildings and can control the things he made Leaf > Thorn Uses vines and leafs to fight and Thorns is spiderman but huge thorny vines Wind > Tornado Controls wind and tornado is just wind but 20x faster and stronger Light > Solar light is superman heat vision except that you can also release it from your fingertips too and solar is just beams of light except as hot as the sun and solar blasts Note: Using these abilities he can create stuff like lightning swords, ice cannon machine guns that can create ice mountains, massive fire chakrams etc. He can use all these abilities at once unleashing seven of himself each controlling an element. He can also fuse with others of himself to combine elements. Example: Ice + Blaze = Frostfire Here are some of his best feats: 1. Shoots a solar beam to destroy a black hole 2. Sends down a huge blazing meteor on an enemy 3. Creates a Giant Ice Mountain freezing his enemy 4. Creates a giant tornado to suck in an enemy, proceeds to turn the tornado into fire then proceeds to turn it into ice, freezing the enemy If you want to know more about him search it up on google and if you want to see his full capabilities search these fights up: Boboiboy vs Borara Boboiboy vs Reta'kka Boboiboy vs Captain Vargoba He has high durability being able to casually tank being inside a black hole. Yes I know the names are cringy His speed scales from high bullet timer to FTL. Speed feats: Escapes a black hole Catches Borara who is able to teleport Moves through huge distances in seconds Watch the Borara fight it's his best fight in the series His solar and light elements are able to manipulate photokinetic energy meaning he should have FTL speed He has good instinctive reaction by catching a shield flying towards him at high speeds Note: His lightning once managed to revert a crazed cat back to it's normal state meaning he might have low mind manipulation He also has the ability to perform multifold attacks which are basically attacks with tens to hundreds of times their power. He has minor resistances to: Poison, Radiation, Status Effect Inducement, Mind Manipulation, Sleep Manipulation Standard equipment: His elemental watch Ochobot WHAT is Ochobot? Ochobot is a power sphere that gave him the elemental watch. It's basically a robot ball that has human levels of intelligence, maybe higher. It can talk to Boboiboy like a human. Ochobot's abilities: Power Nullification Absorption Intergalactic Teleportation Analyzation of objects Hacking Power Bestowal Note: Boboiboy's power is weaker when he splits. Fusion is 2x stronger than using a single element but Splitting can also make a variety of combos and attacks for him to use. I'd say that when he splits into all 7 clones they are as twice as weak compared to when used alone. So, what's the strongest character he can defeat?",You haven't given and feats of durably. Is he pretty much invulnerable? Would a 30mm auto cannon stop him is he human? Can he fight off psychic powers. Can he tank power weapons?

Introduction: The Piggie Squad Mimi Soul Gem A mama pig with an attitude. Her squeaks have a very commanding effect on the other guinea pigs and she is never afraid to demand treats. When she gets in a mood, there is no stopping her. Beethoven Time Gem This guinea pig is believed to be the honest-to-god spirit of Ludwig van Beethoven reincarnated due to an undocumented temporal paradox from another dimension. He enjoys classical music, shuffling backwards, and carrots. Shadow Space Gem Notorious for his shenigans, Shadow has mastered the art of sneaking out of cages. Once biting a hole through the plastic bottom, pulling the latch out of the door, and running off after faking an injury. His cunning is legendary. Gilles Mind Gem A very posh piglet, Gilles is an intellectual. He can perform several tricks, like dunking a miniature basket ball into a hoop or pushing a toy scooter. His favorite hobby is stashing away treats in secret and mediating conflict between Mimi and Buster. Whisper Reality Gem The brattiest piglet of the bunch, Whisper has made her name an oxymoron. She is very territorial and demands treats constantly. She also loves being outside and wrapped in her blanket. She enjoys travel, being outside, and TV of all things. Buster Power Gem Beware. This piggie has a mean bite and will not be afraid to lash out against those he does not like. He is often cranky, squeaking angrily when disturbed. His rival is Mimi, who often challenges his sense of independance and sheer strength.

"argumenta sobre: Average medieval peasant VS. average 21th century thug, who wins? Both combatants are using melee weapons of their time Both are wearing clothing of their time without armor Who wins?","Two factors are important. Firstly, an average modern thug will be several inches taller and much heavier than the average medieval peasant. Secondly, ""melee weapons of their time"" can mean VERY different things. For the thug it could be a baseball bat, a switchblade, a hand taser, or even just a length of 2x4. For the medieval peasant, if they live under a noble that doesn't require them to serve in a reserve conscription army, it probably means a pitchfork, an axe, a sickle, or some other piece of improvised farming equipment, if they are part of a lord's reserve conscription force, it almost certainly means a spear. &x200B; Either way, in almost all scenarios the peasant wins because their weapon has longer reach. The best scenario for the thug is if the peasant gets a regular knife or a sickle and the thug gets a baseball bat or something else with more reach, then their increased size might begin to matter. Edit: Also while the thug would absolutely be stronger and larger, don't pretend that medieval peasants were completely malnourished and barely holding on. They worked long days doing hard grueling work, they would definitely be smaller, but they'd be in relatively decent shape for their size assuming no disease/illness."

"argumenta sobre: The Real world where the wizarding world declares all out war against humanity. How long would the wizards last? Rules: 1. Its not a sneak attack.

All others just live where they live, until they are iced by a death squad of human soldiers. 4. No side is willing to concede, its a war to complete genocide. 5. Only spells mentioned in books exist. You cant make shit up, like Hogwarts being shielded against conventional weaponry etc. Since there is no ""warheado dissapearo"" or ""Flako jacketo"" spell, so they cant do that.","The answer to this entirely depends on whether these are actual competent wizards with the Potterverse powerset, or the caricatures largely depicted in the books. Realistically, if wizards are smart, they stomp. Between invisibility, mind reading, mind control, shapeshifting, and teleportation, a single squad of aurors is going to completely demolish the muggle chain of command. Whenever this comes up, people act like it's going to be two armies shooting at each other in a field. No, wizards are going to teleporting around reading minds, Imperiusing key targets and sowing complete chaos. The entire Muggle war machine is going to grind to a complete halt in literal hours. Wizards won't be getting ""blown up"" because those bomb launches will never get approved. But that's assuming wizards actually use their capabilities. If they're stupid, they get stomped. Canonically, we have examples of both, because Harry Potter is a children's series with a whimsical tone. Wizards are often written as complete imbeciles because it's funny. At the same time, a wizard successfully infiltrated the UK PM's office and became his best employee. They sent professional-looking black-tinded cars to pick up the Weasleys and drive them around at one point. They are clearly capable of understanding the muggle world when it's important."

"argumenta sobre: Could Matt Murdock bring Bruce Wayne to trial in Gotham? ""The thing about Red - they can't tell how much you're bleeding"" It isn't known to the people of Gotham, but the city is ruled by one man. The money flows, to, from, or in purposeful streams around one man. Justice is an extension of one man's will. When the city cries out, one man answers. Bruce Wayne. This concentration of power in the hands of one unaccountable rich vigilante doesn't sit well with Matt Murdock, who takes it upon himself to end Batman - to strip him of his mystique, pull him from his cave, and to introduce Gotham to the man they've trusted, in fear and in hope. Rules: Matt has 2 years for his investigation. If relevent legal action isn't taken against Bruce Wayne within 2 years, Matt loses. The trial can take as long as necessary, regardless of the 2 year limit. Murdock isn't interested in killing Batman, just ending his extrajudicial hold on Gotham. He also isn't interested in causing more crime, just dealing with Bruce Wayne. While he may work with someone like Amanda Waller or the DA's office, he isn't going to team up with the joker, nor will he actively interfere with and ongoing criminal investigations by the police or Batman. Matt won't falsify any evidence against Batman, merely collect proof of his actions for presentation and narrative to the people of Gotham. Any crimes Bruce might have committed while acting in the capacity or interests of Batman are relevant. Success isn't about Batman necessarily dying, or being broke, or not fighting crime- Success comes from Matt Murdock meaningfully changing the relationship between Batman, Bruce Wayne, and Gotham, through only the presentation of facts, material evidence, and their interplay with the law. Batman being unmasked and ultimately being found innocent of any wrongdoing by the people of gotham for instance would totally fit this criteria. Bruce has full access to his normal resources, channels, and relationships. If necessary he can bring the bat family to bear where relevant. He isn't initially aware of Matt, Daredevil, or his legal pursuit of either Bruce Wayne/Batman. MATT WINS If Batman/Bruce Wayne can be brought to trial and a verdict is reached. BRUCE WINS If Daredevil/Matt is unable to collect enough evidence to present a meaningful challenge to Batman's status as a crime fighter in Gotham. This might come through Daredevil being unable to acquire enough legally admissible evidence, or from Bat & Co. beating the ever-loving shit out of Daredevil to the point he's unable to continue his investigation. In all instances consider the characters to be relative composites at the height of their abilities, divorced from any specific points in the story. Scenarios: Netflix Daredevil vs NolanVerse Batman. Netflix Daredevil vs. DCEU Batman 616-Devil vs. Post-Crisis Batman 616-Devil vs. New52/Doomsday Clock/Whatever the technical name for the current incarnation of Batman is. Bonus Scenario: Can any main-stream, long-running version of Batman be brought to trial and actually found guilty of crimes relevant to being Batman? Clarifying Edits Unmasking Batman with incontrovertible proof is a moral victory because it holds Bruce Wayne accountable to the actions of Batman, but it isn't a trial. Half points. Matt Murdock obviously isn't the DA, but it's legal to practice law in different states so long as you've passed the relevant bar exam. Additionally, Murdock has experience pressing DA's to pursue cases they might not pursue otherwise. This is more a question about Matt's investigative abilities, less a question of his experience in pre-trial procedure. How Matt gets involved with this case is left as an exercise to the reader and shouldn't ultimately impact an answer. Batman using his money to influence judges/jurors etc. In his favor is exactly the sort of reason Matt would dislike Bruce and go after him. It's one thing to practice vigilantism, it's another to actively interfere with criminal trials. Also double bonus: 1990s Spiderman Cartoon vs TAS Batman? Sure what the hell, i ain't the battle board police. second clarifying edit Excellent discussions, with some interesting questions that ultimately play to the heart of the matter: Has Batman left enough evidence that a similarly skilled vigilante could reasonably connect the dots and direct the GCPD through an investigation that would be enough for a DA to bring charges. To wit: yes. There's too much DNA, too many financial irregularities in Wayne Enterprise, too many holes in Bruce Wayne's various alibis, and too many loose ends Bruce can't afford to or won't tie up. Would this actually go to trial? Extremely unlikely. Bruce Wayne owns Gotham's justice system. Would the evidence result in a conviction: technically no, but likely as a matter of Jury Nullification. The evidence is there, but a jury would likely let Batman walk. Would this result in the irrefutable unmasking of Batman? Yes, most likely. Someone in Gotham wants this information to be a matter of public knowledge, and even if Bruce can buy every paper legally he can't and stop every news broadcast- Daredevil could get the most damning evidence out somehow.","I'm not a lawyer, but I think I need some clarification on your parameters before answering. It sounds like you're setting up a criminal court case, except these types of cases can only be filed by the State of Federal Government. So in order for this to be a valid scenario Matt would need to be working directly for the DA, which gives him a fighting chance to break through the wall of cash that protects Bruce Wayne. I think the letter agencies FBI/NSA/CIA etc would probably have enough data/evidence to convince a grand jury. Fairly certain in both our and the fictional universes Patriot Act -type legislation would help get around that pesky 4th amendment for a case of this caliber. But even given the financial backing of the federal gov, I don't think Matt stands a chance. All Bruce/Batman has to do is convince whoever is higher up the Federal food chain to drop the case, including going all the way to up the Attorney General/POTUS. Blackmailing/Coercing/Removing elected officials is probably just another Tuesday night for Batman. Additionally, in theory these would all be Bruce's 'kind of people' anyway so it could be as easy as just calling in a favor or two. There maybe a case of Matt becoming a ""Rogue DA"" but Bruce can turn that into a political shit show by going on a media smear campaign to turn public perception against Matt, additionally Matt is a hypocrite a lawyer who operates outside the law as a vigilante and that would be easy enough to leverage against him. Even assuming an unlimited budget and unshakable political will to prosecute Bruce can just lean on the jury and buy them off/intimidate them as needed. Depending on the universe we're using it might be challenging to find 12 people willing to prosecute the vigilante that's regularly saving the world as every government institution is either directly responsible for or completely inept to fight the daily world ending threats. Ok what about Civil Court? As in Matt Murdock sues Bruce for damages. On the plus side he doesn't need to convince the jury ""Beyond Reasonable Doubt"" and only needs to meet to lower bar of ""Preponderance of evidence"". On the downside Matt is a poor dude and Bruce is a rich dude. Bruce stomps this scenario by drowning Matt in legal fees before the case is even brought to court. However, I will say that there is a modicum of victory for Matt if he manages to get Bruce in court even if there's a ""Non-guilty"" verdict because at that point Batman's cover is blown. No court case is going to be able to wash the public perception the dude is probably Batman and there would be way too much public interest for people to just stop trying to figure out Batman's identity and blindly accept the non-guilty verdict. No matter the verdict Batman would need to switch things up permanently maybe a full time Bruce clone/double/robot etc for the rest of his vigilante career and he would never be able to get from under suspicion."

"argumenta sobre: Which real-world human would be most successful if transported back in time 100y? 200y? 1000y? Success here is defined by making a positive, lasting impact on the world and derailing the course of history. If that's not specific enough, let success be operationalized by making a bajillion moneys and becoming the richest person on earth. They choose where on earth they spawn, but they can't use the spawn itself to their advantage, eg as a sign of their miraculous, supernatural origin. So they have to spawn anonymously somewhere in an unobserved public place. Curious also how different time periods affect the answer. The skills needed to be successful 100ya are quite different from those needed to be successful 1000ya. So let's subdivide this question into: 1. 100y: sandwiched between the World Wars on the cusp of the Great Depression 2. 200y: the Industrial Revolution is picking up steam -- the first electric generator is a few years away, but in 1825 the world's first steam-powered passenger train ran on a public line 3. 500y: the Age of Discovery is here, Martin Luther just published his Ninety-five Theses, and we're a century removed from the first printing press but a century away from the first newspaper 4. 1000y: Europe's getting medieval and China's four great inventions spread 5. 2000y: Pax Romana is underway and Jesus is doing his thing 6. 5000y: Mesopotamia's making stuff out of bronze and we've a century to wait till the first Egyptian pyramids 7. 20000y: Our species has dispersed throughout Eurasia and Oceania, and Upper Paleolithic tools are giving humans the edge over Pleistocene megafauna during the Last Glacial Maximum And let's further subdivide each question into: A Currently living humans B All humans throughout all of history so long as they weren't yet alive at the time of their transport back Our time-traveling transplant otherwise arrives without preparation, but wearing clothing appropriate to their environment + plausible documentation attesting to the identity and station of the ""median"" person within a radius of 100mi of wherever they spawn.

I know my boy Michael Jai White is an easy answer.,"Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, Dolph Lundgren, Scott Adkins. Edit: Forgot Jason Statham"
"argumenta sobre: Could humans survive a cordinated ant uprising? As you might know, ants have either the same biomass as we have , or even higher than we do. This gives a question, could a organised ant uprising succeed, and what would be their best course of action? The rules are \- Humans are unaware of ant uprising, until it is undeniable few humans dying here and there is not enought, it needs to be entire villages being wiped of the map \- Worker ants have standard inteligence They can not build tools outside of those that they could resonably use, but due to trial and error they could for example figure out how to either chew cables or clog engines \- Logistics still apply for both ants and humans - Ants still have to eat, they can not just teleport across the continent - They could use either captured human food, small animals or even dead humans as sustenance, so it is not hopeless \- Each ant queen gains the ability to communicate with other ant queens, and they have inteligence of a person - This is the only 100% fantasy rule",Humans. There is nothing ants could do to kill a human. We would just slowly stomp them all to mush.
argumenta sobre: Darth Vader vs Revan Who would win? Peak Canon Darth Vader vs peak Revan? On top of that if Revan were to be defeated are there any ancient Sith that could beat Vader? Edit-added canon Vader for clarification.,"It's tough because it completely depends which sources were pulling from. For Revan is it just the games or extra material? For Vader is it just the movies, or all canon material, or even legends material? Vader is tough to assess because different sources will estimate differently just how much his injuries hamper his ability to use the Force."

argumenta sobre: MCU Black Widow vs Shaq in his prime with training Natasha Romanov and prime Shaq are for some reason going to battle to the death. There are no weapons or backup. R1: Shaq spends a year using his normal Lakers training assets to get in the best fighting shape possible. R2: Shaq takes a year of boxing lessons and conditioning R3: Shaq becomes a black belt in BJJ from a good school,I feel like people are going to think about this in the wrong way. I feel like people are going to think about a highly trained Russian spy about Scarlet Johansson size with immense hand to hand combat and put that up against a prime Shaq with training. That is the incorrect way to think about this. Natasha Romanov is by all intense and purpose a superhero. The things she does are only possible in fictional universes. She is essentially peak human in comic book terms. That's not a real thing in our world. Black Widow beats shaq with 10 years of training in 3 seconds. It's no contest. Shaq with training for a year vs a real world equivalent of a women who would go through a similar program to the black widows is a completely different story. The size difference is probably too immense there.

Now that he has collected all the Infinity Stones for the Infinity Gauntlet he has become a real threat for the Empire.

Round 1: Darth VaderCanon Vs. ThanosMCU Round 2: Darth VaderLegends Vs. Thanos616,"R1: With the Gauntlet as implied by your setup scenario? Vader can't win. The Infinity Stone hax are just too powerful for Vader to really stop. Remember the Power Stone was allegedly capable of wiping out all life on Xandar just by Ronan touching the ground with it. While ""the power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force"", Vader, and in fact no force wielder in canon, can actually use it at anything approaching a planetary scale. Without the Gauntlet MCU Thanos doesn't have a way around Telekinesis and could lose, but if he manages to get close he'll rip Vader's head off. R2: Thanos laughs off Vader's best Effort and proceeds to hand off the Gauntlet to the Black Order, tell his men to stand down, beat the brakes off of Vader, and finally solo the Imperial Fleet."

argumenta sobre: Liberty Prime Fallout vs an AT-AT Star Wars Wide open field.,"Not too familiar with Fallout, but looking at the respect thread and seeing that Liberty Prime insta-dies to these little explosions it clearly doesn't have the durability to hang with an AT-AT for more than a couple seconds; they spam shots which create comparable explosions with ammo counts that might as well be infinite. But if Liberty Prime can toss nukes then it should be able to kill an AT-AT pretty quickly as well. So it comes down to ""who lands a hit first"", basically, and I'm seeing nothing in the respect thread that gives Liberty Prime any chance under the prompt specification of a ""wide open field"". LP's laser is described as being accurate to a range of ""hundreds of yards""; the AT-AT's weaponry has an effective range of over a dozen kilometers. And Prime is clearly slow as hell so it's not dodging anything while it tries to get into range; AT-ATs and their pilots are accustomed to tagging much smaller and more mobile targets than LP, even shooting snowspeeders out of the sky during the Battle of Hoth. Again, not familiar with Fallout so I might be missing something, but just going off the respect thread Prime is turned to slag far before it's ever in range."
"argumenta sobre: Could the Penguins of Madagascar turn the nation of Madagascar into a well-developed, first-world country? Currently, Madagascar is not a great place to live in.

The Penguins of Madagascar have 10 years, which is roughly the rest of their natural lifespan, to raise Madagascar's Human Development Index into the category of ""High human development"". At the end of the decade, Madagascar must also rank above the world average at that time, which would make Madagascar's living standards comparable to China, Peru, and Ukraine.","The real question is whether or not any of Madagascar's citizens will listen to the Penguins.

EDIT: The battle will take place in a dimension where nobody has ever heard of either opponent, to make this more fair.

argumenta sobre: Jiraiya naruto V.S. Gojo JJK Jiraiya during the 3rd great ninja war arc. Just because they both have white hair and were around the same age,"I don't see anything Jiraya shows us getting around Infinity. Even the Sage Mode Genjutsu he used against Pain requires the target to be able to hear him, and Gojo is shown to filter out dangerous sounds early on in his fight with Jogo. While Jiraya definitely out-stat's Gojo, There's not a whole lot he can do while infinity is active. I also don't think he has the ability to dodge Infinite void, should Gojo resort to it, which would normally provide an opportunity to strike during the CT burnout that happens as a result of expanding one's Domain. But, because it's Gojo, Jiraya would actually have to be able to Dodge IV multiple times, as Gojo is shown to get around this by purposefully damaging and repairing the part of his brain responsible for his CT, effectively negating the recovery time. It took several Domain expansions for him to reach his limit in this regard. So yeah, I can't see Jiraya winning this."

Vehicles with their own bludgeoning weapons rams etc do not count. However something like a tank with an armhole for swinging a bat would be legal.

He must get through every single Goldcloak, Lannister soldier stationed in the city, and Kingsguard with the final bosses being The Hound and Ser Barristan. No stealth or sneaky shit.","With reflexes fast enough to catch arrows and the strength to cave in a man's chest in a single blow, Cap should take this. His suit is highly protective, but if he stayed put, he'd eventually get overwhelmed and get stabbed in more vulnerable areas. The only option is to just run around, taking out guards as he goes. I mean, we saw him survive being surrounded by ravenous creatures with claws capable of piercing the Hulkbuster. I genuinely believe he'd be fine."

It is the Texas of sci-fi, so to speak. 40K's poster boys, the Astartes are among the most dangerous super soldiers in fiction. What beats them?

In both rounds the Astartes get obliterated. For round 1 the Swiss Guardsmen have armor good enough that a weapon that could punch through 500 meters of rock was expected to do basically nothing to it. Their armor is expected to keep the wearer alive inside a kiloton range fireball. Their weapons would be more powerful than what we see the earlier era FORCE Multipurpose Rifle it has the aforementioned BHEE keeper that could go through 500m of rock and lasers which can melt several cubic meters of sand in moments. They are expected to be able to engage enemies on nearby moons. To top that all off they are invisible, can fly and have a bunch of fairly powerful sensors. If you are worried about them being slow the much earlier FORCE armor can throw a punch which breaks the sound barrier. Their armor also can automatically engage enemy targets that it detects. For round 2 The Shrike is more of an Imperium ending threat. There isn't really an amount of Space Marines that could beat it. Round 6: just focusing on armored SF characters, Culture combat drones or combat suits, Polity war drones, 5th Imperium marines Dahak, Imperial Cadre or also probably Marines In Fury Borne, Marines later parts of the Galactic Marine Saga, ACS infantry Posleen War, Sam Gideon Vanquish, Zentradi in a battlesuit Macross, Safeguards Blame!"

Let's also assume that the player is reluctant to risk a 33% chance of losing the Wish spell forever.","I don't know who it would be but they would have to be someone extremely powerful. If you max out every class in DnD the PC would have thousands of HP, meaning they're more durable than any being in the Forgotten Realms including the gods. They'd have spell slots for days and would be masters of all forms of combat. Even setting aside Wish, they could still cast True Polymorph, Meteor Swarm, Power Word Kill, Imprisonment, etc. And even if someone manages to somehow overcome all that, they could have cast Clone 4 months earlier and just respawn.

For more than a hundred centuries... wait, nevermind, that's changed. Every single Imperium planet magically disappears. Instead, the United Federation of Planets from Star Trek shows up, with the whole shebang: planets, space stations, fleets, named characters, etc The Federation is as of 2363, aka the year Picard becomes captain of the Enterprise-D. The 40k Galaxy is as of the end of the Plague Wars. Note that Federation space is much smaller than the Imperium was. Nobody gains any automatic knowledge of anyone else. The Federation must figure out the situation by themselves, and all other factions must do the same with the Federation. Star Trek style Warp travel works as normal, except it doesn't work through 40k-style Warp storms. Notably this means crossing the Cicatrix is a challenge. Federation races are as subject to Chaos and the other horrors of the 40k galaxy as anyone else. Importantly this means Federation races can start to see psykers emerging, with all that entails. Diplomacy can unfold without any special limitations, but every faction is in character aka Chaos won't suddenly start being benevolent because Picard gave them a talking to. Goals To win the scenario, the Federation must: - survive - not renounce its fundamental principles aka not turn into the Imperium - eliminate or otherwise neutralise the major irreducible threats, like Chaos, Orks and Tyranids Can they do it? if they can, how long does it take them?","The main reason why the Imperium has held back Chaos has been their insane religious devotion and willingness to cull the unclean.

"argumenta sobre: What fictional teacher or mentor would have the best shot shot at turning Greg Heffley,from Diary of a Wimpy Kid, into a ""badass""? Heffley doesn't need to become the next John Wick Even though i have a wild guess that he would love that, but at the very least, he needs to give up his ""wimpy"" ways and act like a proper, mature person that can handle himself in a fight. Greg gets a month of training with his mentor He will be in-character and at first be dismissive of the help they are trying to give him, but can give in and even develop a bond with his mentor if they have enough patience The mentor can use any powers he has to help Greg, BUT they can't affect him directly. For example, they can give him a magic dumbbell that gives him triplified training effectiveness, but they can't use some kind of reality warping power to transform him into Jojo character from part 2. Greg's family will know about this mentor, and will react accordingly, which means that unless the mentor can convince then they are really trying to help Greg, they might have to train him in secret. Can Greg finally become a respectable citizen or will he stay as one of the weakest characters in fiction? Edit: I just noticed that i wrote ""shot"" two times in the title. Dammit.","Uncle Iroh. I think that regardless of whether or not the kid learns to throw a punch, he'll be a badass human being as a whole."

"argumenta sobre: Who would win: A Roman army or a medieval army? Regarding the legions, I'm thinking of a late republic/early empire type of legion, the type of men who would have served under Caesar. And for the medieval army, I'm thinking of, roughly, a late year 1000 army, think the battle of Hastings. I don't know the appropriate sizes or amounts; I know a good bit about these forces but I don't know all the details. Round 1: Equally sized infantry armies. The exact amount is up to you, but scale up or down where you need to for these armies to have the same number of men. Round 2: Equally sized full armies. Anything these armies would have had the ability to bring with them is considered here, cavalry, archers, charities, catapults, anything. Round 3: Same as round one but without the equally sized parts. The size which again, I don't know I suppose would be whatever a general of their respective time periods would have considered a decently sized army. Round 4: Same as round 2 but with round 3's size guides. Anyway, I'm curious to see what people think on this one.",You should have posted this in . Watching Goku v.

Hundreds. They'd have to rely on wearing the custodes down and hitting with plasma because if they go into melee they're immediately dead. Having two custodes together is a big difference compared to just one. R2 normal equipment for custodes? Thousands casually. The predators will struggle to even hurt them while the custodes are likely going to hunt them down, bait into favorable environments, and simply bleed the predators out. It would take a single bolt round or slice to kill a predator while their auspex would likely see through the stealth. Bonus: unsure, queens are pretty crazy the last time I checked. A few dozen?

I would even have the science explaining narrator explain that Compound V is a polar molecule, meaning it arranged itself along its dipole interactions due to the hamon, and the power of sunlight burned it up. This leaves homelander powerless, which gives JoJo the ability to use a trick to plant a grenade on Homelander's shoulder, which Homelander throws, only to realize that JoJo planted 45 grenades on his cape, which he only noticed the weight of after throwing the grenade.

Bonus round: would the fight have a different result with Batman taking dark wings place? Assuming standard gear","I'm gonna say that probably not. Omni Man and his eventual plan to kill the Guardians as a way of easing the transition to Viltrum rule wasn't some big secret plan that the government or a cabal of Viltrum loyalists kept secret. Omni Man kept his true intentions away from EVERYONE. His PERSEC method of never even alluding to his family what his end goal was meant that's there wouldn't be any loose thread for Batman/Darkwing to pull at. Would Batman have had a better plan or contingency than ""throw some tiny bombs and then try to drop kick the guy that punches ancient gods""? Absolutely. That doesn't somehow mean that he would be able to find evidence for a secret Viltrum invasion though since no evidence outside of Omni Man's personal thoughts ever even existed to be found."

The Tigers have a 40% chance of just breaking down during the fight... if the Romans push in formation, that might just not matter at all, but if they disperse, they could surround the tanks assuming it's a flat terrain with zero cover and maybe force them to use their precious fuel. Depending on model, it's not entirely impossible for them to flat out burn the Germans out. I'd say if the tanks are in perfect working order, they MIGHT have the fuel and ammo to deal enough damage to the Romans to make them retreat...

However, they have infinite chances and they need to adapt to the situation in order to win. The only way to get out of their time loops is that they defeat their heroic opponents and change the outcomes of their fate.

They can achieve this via adapting their goals and their plans, befriending the heroes and then backstabbing them, or any other means of genius successful paths and smart ways towards victory. Round 1: They are not given any information about their situation or how to get out of the loop. So they have to discover why they're stuck.

"argumenta sobre: How would Infinity War go if the Avengers had failed in every previous movie with an infinity stone? So say Thanos gets to Infinity War but instead of how it plays out here the Avengers have been shit at their jobs the whole time. That means: - Captain America actually dies and fails to stop Red Skull and Nazis take over the world and develop weapons up until the events of the first Avengers movie using the Tesseract. - Nazi Avengers and a very conflicted Thor stop the Chitauri and obtain the Mind Stone which Hydra uses. Thor takes the Tesseract to Asgard but not the Mind Stone as he doesn't realize what the Mind Stone is. - Thor fails to stop Malekith from obtaining the Aether as he has no feelings for Nazi Jane Foster. Malekith leaves for space with the Aether and his dark elves. - The Guardians of the Galaxy fails to stop Ronan because Cap let Nazies take over the world and Footloose was never made. Quill doesn't distract Ronan with a dance-off and Ronan obliterates Nova Prime. Ronan rules over the Kree with the Power Stone. - Cap is dead and unable to distract Ultron so Ultron manages to get uploaded into Vision fully with the Mind Stone. Nazi Avengers manages to semi-stop Sokovia but is unable to stop Vision-Ultron. Half the human race is wiped out. Vision-Ultron eventually happens upon Wakanda and creates more Ultron bots with vibranium. Wakanda is not completely wiped out as they have their vibranium dampeners but cannot take out Ultron either. They end up in a deadlock. - Doctor Strange never thinks to look at the mystic arts in this Nazi-fied world. Kaecilius takes over the Ancient's position with Dormammu's help but instead of releasing Dormammu he uses the Time Stone to bring back his family. He keeps the Time Stone and leads the Masters of the Mystic Arts. - Thor is unable to stop Hela and is killed. Hela uses the Tesseract that Thor brought home and leads her undead Asgardian army from Asgard. Ragnarok does not come to pass. - Gamora is never led away by Quill and eventually gives up the location of the Soul Stone to Thanos who sacrifices her and starts off with that one stone. So now Thanos has only the Soul Stone. He faces Malekith with aether, Hela with the tesseract, Ronan with the power stone, Kaecilius with the time stone, and Ultron with the mind stone. This along with their respective armies. Thanos has the Chitauri and his suicidal army as well as his Black Order. Round 1 - Thanos has to get the stones in the order he does in the movie. So power stone to tesseract to aether to time stone to mind stone. Can he do it? Round 2 - Thanos needs all six but he can go in whatever order works best.

It can keep as many cards as it wants in its hand - Each summon, and each card really, is rescaled to be division-sized a division worth of orcs, centaurs, vampyrs, dragons,…. Apart from that, summons can't steal modern equipment or whatever. - As an exception, terrains can never be drawn; instead each Soviet Republic comes predeployed as the terrain it most closely features plains for Ukraine, mountains for Armenia, Forest for Carelia, etc. Those can be lost. Mixed terrains like tundras are in. - After the beginning of the war, every week, terrains untap and the magician can open one booster pack of his choice from a classical non-parody set, not the Dr Who or Warhammer 40K set and use it freely. Summons must be done in controlled territory. - The Axis does not have any spell, just the historical 1941 line-up. There is no land lease. One exception: the German and Romanian, etc high-command is protected from magical direct attacks. - Vehicles are considered artefact, Germans are black, Romanians green, Hungarians red and Finns blue thanks to their lakes.

"argumenta sobre: You go back in time and give George Washington an AK-47 with 10,000 rounds of ammo. Can he conquer the Americas and become Emperor, or even take over the world? Imagine you give George Washington an AK-47 and 10,000 rounds of ammo and train him to use it, then send him back to the late 1700s. With his leadership skills, military competence, and a huge technological edge, can he use this firepower to crush the British, unite the Americas, and become Emperor? And what about the rest of the world, could he take on Europe and expand beyond the New World? Conditions: \- Limited ammo: 10,000 rounds sounds like a lot, but it's still finite. He has to be strategic about when and how he uses it. \- Morality: Washington is power hungry and not humble as he is in our history. Food for thought: Could the people of the time reverse engineer an AK-47 or make something similar? Would Washington's military tactics and the shock value of the AK-47 be enough to build an empire, or would history's challenges prove too much, even with futuristic firepower?","The machining required to create an AK-47 is so far out of reach at that time. They would probably document it well and it MIGHT push technology in a little different of a direction. The self loading cartridge wasn't really that crazy of an idea, it was just hard to produce because precise machining didn't really exist. As for George Washington using it to good affect, It wouldn't really do anything major. Sure 10,000 rounds is a lot but best case that is 10,000 more killed. You would be better off sending him with the smallpox vaccine."
"argumenta sobre: One blackhawk helicopter vs the entirety of ancient Rome at the height of its power. Here's she scenario: Blackhawk team- A time wizard teleports the following to a uncharted 10x10 mile island off the coast of Europe at the point in time when ancient Rome was at its most powerful: - a blackhawk helicopter armed with 2 20mm cannons, rockets, and a door mounted mini gun - a skilled blackhawk crew - 5 skilled blackhawk mechanics - a barracks that the men sleep in and serves as a living quarters, mess hall etc. - helipad - big ass warehouse filled with everything that you'd need to maintain and support the men, and blackbird for years. Spare parts, fuel, tools, ammo, food, water, guns for hunting, sea water purification system, & whatever else. - enough solar panels to power everything. The wizard tasks the men with basically genociding Rome in order to return to their own time. And the wizard assures them, that their timeline will remain the same because completing this task would just create an alternate timeline separate from their own which he needs for his plans. The Romans: Are the Romans at their peak of power in ancient times not much to say. Do they have anything that can stop an armed blackhawk chopper?","I think it kinda depends on victory conditions. If you mean ""genocide Rome"" literally, then no. The ancient Italians will make babies faster than Blackhawk can kill them. If you mean ""genocide the Roman Empire"" I.e. bring the empire to an end as a historical entity, then yeah they could do that. It would involve strafing runs of the city of Rome every day. They wouldn't be able to kill all citizens, but they would make it seem like a cursed place and would essentially cut the heart out of the Roman Empire. The empire would break up and you'd have lots of different romans in control of their regions and territories, but ""Rome"" would no longer be an empire."

argumenta sobre: Mr. Incredible The Incredibles vs Homelander The Boys Both are in character Win by any means Starts 500 meters apart from each other Location: Parking lot at a Macy's,"Homelander has a few advantages over Mr. Incredible. He can fly, he's got laser eyes, and he can move at supersonic speeds. Mr. Incredible on the other hand is a couple orders of magnitude stronger and more durable than Homelander and he has far more experience fighting superpowered foes on his own level than Homelander does. In-character Homelander typically fights in melee. Even against superpowered foes near his own abilities he rarely uses his speed or flight in combat except to close the distance with them. And if he gets within grabbing range of Mr. Incredible even once the fight is probably over. Homelander's only chance here is to stay in the air and use his speed and laser eyes against Mr. Incredible, but even that's not a guarantee. Mr. Incredible is far more durable than any other target Homelander has ever tried to laser, there's no guarantee the laser eyes would actually damage Mr. Incredible. And Bob has quite a few feats of throwing objects long distances with excellent accuracy, so picking up cars or lightpoles and knocking Homelander out of the sky with them is a possibility. And Homelander also has a whole bunch of psychological buttons to push to anger him and make him fight angrily instead of tactically. I won't say Homelander has zero chance of winning, but Mr. Incredible wins this one 9/10 times."

He has no internet access or helpers, but he must find a way to defend himself. After 24 hours are up, Rational Man with a Shotgun enters the Home Depot and attempts to hunt down RMwaHD. RMwaHD has basic adult competency with the tools available to him, but has no specific scientific, carpentry, or engineering training. RMwaS gets one fully loaded pump shotgun, but no additional shells, so only 10 rounds. Once the fight starts, neither may leave the store. Fight is to death or incapacitation. Round 1: Prompt as stated Round 2: RMwaHD gets access to an internet enabled smartphone. RMwaS carries infinite ammo, but must reload after every 10 rounds fired. Round 3: RMwaHD gets access to an internet enabled smartphone and a store employee who is familiar with the store and can do things like fetch items and assist with rote construction tasks but must leave before the fight starts. RMwaS gets infinite ammo and police-level body armor Bonus: As round 3, but RMwaHD now has the composite engineering and scientific knowledge of Walter White and Jamie Hyneman. RMwaS now additionally gets his choice of any civilian-grade small arms and a full set of riot gear. Bonus 2: Since we seem to have reached a consensus that RMwaHD has a huge advantage here. How many of the bonus round version RMwaS would it take to 5/10 or better RMwaHD?","I'm in a Home Depot right now. I say RMwaHD stomps all rounds, mainly because it's not hard to drive a forklift.

Also, Home Depot is filled with sharp objects that can be thrown, and it's not a very open area inside the store. Edit: Round 3 and 4 aren't stomps. Maybe 50/50 in round 3. Round 4 probably 80/20 for Shotgun; riot gear is a game changer."

"argumenta sobre: The Gods task Humanity with eradicating a species of their choice within 1 year. If this species must have at least 10,000 living members, which would be the best choice? In this scenario, the Gods have decided to test humanity's resourcefulness and efficiency by tasking them to hunt a single species of animal into extinction within a single year. HOW THIS THING WORKS 1 Every human is magically made aware of the challenge at the same time. Humanity knows that they have 1 month to put in their vote for a species to eradicate, with the species obtaining most votes ending up the target. Afterwards, they have 11 months to make sure not a single member of that species remains alive. 2 If humanity does not achieve this objective, it will be wiped from the face of the earth. Every human instinctively knows that this is an undeniable truth. 3 The species that is chosen must have at least 10,000 living members. So a species like the Giant Panda, estimated to have just around 2,000-2,500 living members, cannot be selected. Otherwise, there are no limitations. 4 At the start of every day, each human will obtain a message stating how many members of the selected species have been killed, how many have been born, and how many in total remain. Humanity is not informed where the remaining living members are, just how many are left. What animal species would give humanity the highest chance at fulfilling this challenge?","> 3 The species that is chosen must have at least 10,000 living members. So a species like the Giant Panda, estimated to have just around 2,000-2,500 living members, cannot be selected. Otherwise, there are no limitations. So NO LIMITATIONS on the species having to be an Animal. And NO LIMITATIONS on the species having to be naturally occurring. Here is the way to do this with the least impact on the ecosystem, which coincidentally may also be the most cost effective. And which definitely shows: > humanity's resourcefulness and efficiency We take a strain of bacteria into a level 4 bio safety laboratory. We start genetically altering those bacteria until they are considered a different species from the wild counterpart by EVERY definition of the word species that applies to bacteria. We breed them on agar plates until the counter is WAY past the 10000 mark. Then throw ALL the plates into an autoclave and be done with it."

Light is in the same mindset as he was against L and when he had the Death Note and of course Cartman is in his mindset against Scott Tenorman and is definitely bloodlusted.","This is a high-quality prompt. I think Cartman is able to pull off revenge, but halfway through explaining his plan Light would catch up, explain the rest of the plan back to Cartman, and end with a twist he just devised that ends with Light marrying Cartman's mom."

Respect thread for Rico The GTA Online character has maxed-out stats, access to every weapon, every weaponized vehicle, all SecuroServ abilities, both the MOC and Avenger, an Office, a Bunker, a Hangar, a Facility, and enough cash that they can afford to pay all the necessary costs to use any of this. They have access to the orbital cannon, but as Rico is not a GTA Online player they cannot use the automatic targeting. If they want to have a vehicle delivered, they have to wait for Johnny On The Spot to spawn it nearby. If they want Bull-Shark Testosterone delivered, they have to wait for an airdrop similar to Rico. The GTA Online character has the mindset of the average GTA Online player, so they will be hell-bent on killing Rico on sight. R1: They start a block apart and can only use ground vehicles. R2: Rico starts at the Grapeseed airfield whilst the GTA Online character starts at the airport, and can use any vehicles and abilities they want. Bonus round: If/when the GTA Online character is killed, they get mad and challenge Rico to a first-to-five-kills deathmatch Rico gains GTA Online respawn mechanics.","Rico stomps all rounds.

argumenta sobre: Starkiller original Star Wars: The Force Unleashed VS. Clive Rosfield Final Fantasy 16 Your bets?,"If Clive is actually going all out, it's a literal stomp. I know people like to throw out things like ""coughing baby versus hydrogen bomb"" around here, but it's unironically even more one-sided than that. Starkiller would have an easier time fighting the Death Star. If he's stuck in human form Starkiller might be able to win by just using the Force to levitate Clive into the air and then just backstab him, or if Clive is using one of the non-magical swords and doesn't realize the lightsaber will cleave right through it that might get him.

I'm not sure if you're counting height and intellect in this because this mf is going to be 9 ft tall or more in that case and given the colossal intelligence difference between new borns and adults he'd have an off the chart iq level.

Round 2: You remain your current age and no one would question it e.g. if you were a kid then but an adult now, you would be an adult in 2001 and everyone would treat you like one, including people who know you. Round 3: Round 1 but you have 1 week research/prep time before you get sent back in time. Round 4: Round 2 but with the extra time of round 3. You do not have to give a binary answer of if you could completely stop it or not. Can you save one person? Can you stop one plane?

Special round 1: The age you were then, but you are not allowed to be found guilty of any crimes and are not allowed to die. You can be arrested, but it must be a situation where you are released for doing it to save lives or something.

I'll call in a bomb threat to the Twin Towers and get it evacuated, so far fewer people die.

Maybe I can ground one of the planes by sneaking through airport security and taking a shit in one of the planes?

Cyberpunk 2077's Arasaka Corporation with its resources, technology and owned private army against what is considered the most powerful military forces on Earth in 2025. Arasaka Corporation has all its weaponry Supercarrier Kujira which we really have no infos about, cybernetics, robots, cyborgs, etc., which... actually prompts some questions on my end - would quickhacking and Daemons/Rogue AIs be able to functions or does its things as effectively as it did against 2025's technology and networks? Or would our world's internet and networking be far too different for it to work like it would normally be? Arasaka Corporation is holding on Night City, located on the shores of Del Coronado Bay, between North and South California on the Pacific Coast. The US' task is to bring order to chaos that is Night City and neutralize Arasaka's presence in the area. Nuclear isn't an option. 1st Round: The US National Guard is tasked to do this jobs. 2nd Round: US National Guard + the Army 3rd Round: National Guard, Army, and Marines works together 4th Round: Add the Air Force into the Mix 5th Round: Entire might of the US, Army/Marines/Air Force/Navy... and probably Space Force too?","Arasaka has a long history in their world, so if you give them all their assets and not make them just suddenly pop into existence, they would take round 1 and 2 by direct conflict, but otherwise couldn't win an outright war against a unified US. Assuming it's a verse where the US can't just pressure Japan to nationalize Arasaka, the company would work on dividing the American states. The net works somewhat like ours, but netrunners could easily exploit any wireless technology. LANs are safe; those need direct breach, but everything else is up for grabs. Arasaka could cause economic crisis and shut down critical infrastructure, blame the US government, and then fund and offer solutions to states in trouble so that they want to become independent. Then start slamming corpo plazas and factories to produce cheap patented biofuel, cybernetics, laboratory grown body parts, any other major breakthroughs. Arasaka could either sell direct to the consumers, or through 3rd party homeland companies that are bought out of bankruptcy. With how divided the US is right now, it would surely work. oh, there's also the option to shut down world maritime logistics with self-replicating AI ocean mines. there goes the Navy dominance."

But they won't ever be able to expand enough to actually conquer anything significant. They absolutely stomp any 'small scale' battle which come their way.

After those 10 minutes are up, Ben turns back to normal and has a 5 minute recharge time before being able to use another alien. Also, the more transformations he does during that 10 minute time period leaves him with less maximum time, 2 leaves him with 8 minutes, 3 leaves him with 5, 4 leaves him with 3. 4 is the max. Ben is aware of this time limit 5. To clarify, if Ben 10 had used 2 transformations in the span of 4 minutes, then transformed for a 3rd time, he'd have 1 minutes left before his recharge period. If he tried to transform to his 3rd alien at the 7 minute mark, he'd instantly go into recharge mode. 6.

"argumenta sobre: The Most Powerful Rock VS The Most Powerful Paper VS The Most Powerful Scissors Rocks, Paper, Scissors is a classic game of A>B>C>A. It's a fun little circle where no one is stronger than anyone else... but if Rocks, Papers, and Scissors were taken to their ontologically relevant most powerful forms, which would win? The most powerful Rock ever versus the most powerful Paper ever versus the most powerful Scissors ever! Which wins? - I was thinking the Rock would be something like Golden Kryptonite, Infinity Rocks, maybe high end Discworld Trolls. - Paper could be a Wish spell scroll, that infinite book that Superman and Shazam lifted, maybe the book from The Adjustment Bureau? Da Rules? - The scissors could be the scissors the Fates use to cut life strings, or the Killing Good, ""The Cutting and Severing Crime Edge"", or Ryuuko's scissor thing, or the Golden Blade from Flame of Recca.... etc Assume that any item can be used. If it's Gold Kryptonite versus Wish Spell versus Ryuuko's scissor, then the three items are used by three roughly identical individuals. If sentience is involved, then there doesn't have to be a wielder if you don't want. What wins? Rock, Paper, or Scissors in their most powerful forms?",Dimensional scissors win via ring out.

So conditions before set up The Stones Work In Middle Earth This is 2014 Thanos as he and his army appear at the end of Endgame. Thanos Knows that the Stones are there but cannot track where they are in Middle Earth, additionally in any conflict he cannot use his ship. The Stones have been distributed as follows as of the beginning of the LOTR series. The Reality Stone has found its way to Sauron, and is in his possession at Barad-dûr. The Power Stone is in the possession of the fellowship, they know of its destructive capabilities, some wishing to use it just as with the ring which isn't present in this scenario. The Power Stone is housed in a necklace which is worn by Frodo. The Soul Stone will be given to Gandalf when he dies and returns as Gandalf the White, returning embedded in his staff. The Space Stone will be in the hands of Saruman, embedded in his staff already. He has also had a Gauntlet crafted. The Time Stone will be in the possession of Galadriel, which she has hidden in the forest and will fiercely protect and apprehensively use.

"argumenta sobre: Average medieval peasant vs Average Joe today The medieval peasant is your classic peasant. He has a little farm that he tends to. The average Joe is your normal guy who works a desk job. Both are of the average level of fitness you could expect from someone of their lifestyles. Same goes for height, weight, and combat skill relative to their time. Neither is armed with anything other than fists and wit who knows, emotional damage could tip the scales. They are both unarmored, wearing standard garb.","I go with the peasant here. If two untrained people fight, it pretty much comes down to mental toughness. Who wants it more vs who gives up first. Both people more or less lack the ability to hurt each other substantially without weapons or training, given that they are roughly the same size. I simply assume a medieval peasant had a rougher upbringing compared to an average desk guy. Maybe some fights with other kids, a hard life in general, just being tuffer. I therefore think he would win via the desk guy giving up first. If both are bloodlusted, the modern guy wins. Weight wins fights. Modern men are fat."

I just want to know Both of them at their strongest and in character, just random encounter where they have to fight eachother","Zenitsu is definitely able to move faster, but dealing with stronger, faster opponents is what Usopp always does. The fact that Zenitsu is limited solely to swordplay makes him an easy enough threat for Usopp to handle.

Plus, Usopp has shown reaction speeds necessary to keep pace with the whiny blonde. Usopp wins."
"argumenta sobre: The average male human vs a male white tail deer of the same weight as that human. The deer and the human are inside an arena so neither person can run. It is a fight to the death. Both the deer and the human know this and are intent on killing the other. The human has nothing to defend itself with but it's own hands. This is an original idea but after doing some research I found that someone posted something similar on this sub about 5 yrs ago. The post didn't get a lot of traction so I thought I'd post this. Me and my friends have been discussing this and have even asked our family and teachers for their input. I chose a man to fight in the battle instead of a female because while there are many women stronger then men, an average man is stronger than the average women so I thought it would stand a better chance against the deer.","The deer wins this almost every time. The sheer power it would take to break a deers neck is insane, and beyond that I don't see any realistic way to hurt the deer. It is also far faster, making it harder to grab as well. On the deers side, while the antlers are a concern when trying to grapple it, I think the biggest concern for a human are the hooves. Deer can stand on hind legs and move their hooves surprisingly fast, similarly being able to buck. While they're not extremely heavy it is kind of the equivalent of having sharp rocks permanently attached to a humans hands. A swift hit to the head and the human is out for sure.

Click HERE to vote for the winner of the season, who will be crowned on May 28th, 11:59PM PST. --- The Character Scramble is a long-running writing prompt tournament in which participants submit characters from fiction to a specified tier and guideline. After the submission period ends, the submitted characters are ""scrambled"" and randomly distributed to each writer, forming their team for the season. Writers will then be entered into a single-elimination bracket, where they write a story that features their team fighting against their opponent's team. Victors are decided based on reader votes; in other words, if you want people to vote for you, write some good content. The winner by votes of each match-up moves on to the next round. The pattern continues until only one participant remains: the new Character Scramble champion, who gets to choose the theme, tier, and rules of the next Scramble! The theme of Character Scramble 19 is Super Smash Bros. Round prompts will be based on the many Nintendo franchises represented in Smash, along with some of its third party offerings. --- Hub Post Rosters Join the email list! Join the Character Scramble Discord! --- AUDI FANAAAAAAAAAAM You're finally here. You stand on the precipice of the world you've sworn to save. You've made strong allies, faced powerful foes, braved vistas terrible and sublime. Indeed, you've done well to come this far. Victory, and the salvation of your world, is within reach. But just as you reach out to grasp your prize, it extends away from you. Hundreds of crystal steps sprawl into distant space, into a swirling nexus of worlds. One final sprint. THE GREAT MAZE Time is of the essence. The enemy team is making their final moves, and each of you have a lot of ground to cover. Make your way through the stages, overcome the challenges within, and emerge victorious. Be warned though, that not everyone can make it through. As you progress through the Great Maze, your characters will fall one by one, until the last one standing is crowned. There will be no stage select, no bans and counter picks. You will be making your way through all of these prompts. After all, the best sets always go to five. As you take your first steps into the maze, you're greeted by glaring sunlight. Rolling hills and checkerboard patterns sprawl into the distance as palm trees sprout from the verdant earth. You feel the pull of gravity as you approach a slope that leads into… is that a loop-de-loop? STAGE 1: GREEN HILL ZONE As you try to make sense of the twisting paths, however, the enemy team arrives. Suddenly, you feel time itself attack. What you're doing here isn't a normal fight— it's a race. You're Too Slow! This match is a race to the end of the zone. The last ones past the goal post are the first ones eliminated. Green Hill's Looking a Lot More Like Sand Hill! Of course, Green Hill Zone is notoriously overplayed. If you wish to set the race on the deserts of Tatooine or through the mountains of Mordor, by all means. What matters is that you race to win. As you pass the goalpost, the checkerboards dissipate and the grass grows wild. Clouds hover just above, so close you could touch them, and the crests of great cliffs tower in the distance. STAGE 2: GAUR PLAIN The ground beneath you trembles. You look up and see a giant approaching you, ready to fight on behalf of the opposing team. But, big as that baddie is, you can't shake the feeling you might be fighting on something even bigger… You Will Know Our Names: You've stumbled into an area that's way above your level. Not all of your teammates are making it out in one piece. The Bionis and Mechonis: It's giants all the way down. You're not only fighting against a titan, but you are fighting atop even bigger giants, locked in the aftermath of their battle. Describe this setting. For both of these, you can choose whatever giants best fit your setting. However, as it is the 10th anniversary, you are strongly encouraged to take a look at the titans of the past… After slaying the giant, blue skies and green grass give way to stormy clouds and barren wastes. You trudge through the night, until at long last, atop an imposing mountain, backlit by the full moon, you see…. STAGE 3: DRACULA'S CASTLE An ancient evil, once thought to be vanquished, casts their gaze towards you. They seek revenge for their vanquishment, and are even willing to work with the enemy team to ensure they enact their toll… A Terrible Night For a Curse: You will face off against an opponent from your past, someone you have faced in a previous round. They're stronger than ever, and they're not happy… And they are committed to enacting their vengeance. Monster Mash: Though not strictly necessary, Dracula's Castle does often include a menagerie of spooky creatures waiting in the wings. Fill these out as little or as much as you please. But, because it's the finals of the tenth anniversary, take a look at some of the monsters of ages past for inspiration… After defeating your enemy in their lair, you walk deeper and deeper into the castle. Plunging beneath the earth, you feel yourself leave this plane of existence. In the distance you see a light, a single room… and the sounds of mighty beasts. STAGE 4: LIVING ROOM The way forward is guarded not by any titans or lords of the undead this time. Instead, a panel of judges watches intently, waiting to be impressed. If you wanna get through, you're gonna need to be the best in show. And to do that, you'll have to adopt a cat or a dog to defeat your opponent's cat or dog in a contest! Here are the wonderful animals just waiting to be adopted! CATS | DOGS -----|-------- Xiaohei |Den Catra | Legosi Old Hob |Infinite Nepeta Leijon | Doggie Krueger Puss in Boots | Chewbacca What The Dog Doin? That's right, it's Nintendogs/Cats time. Your team must prepare one of these furry critters to fight against your opponent's furry critters in a dog/cat competition. Get Outta Here! Go On! As attached as you have become to you have certainly become to your furry friend, they cannot stay forever. Because… After all the trials and tribulations, only one team member remains. Reality falls apart around them as they hurtle through space, witnessing the collapse of stars, the birth of cosmos. They have reached… FINAL DESTINATION It all comes down to this. One final battle. For the sake of the world. And more importantly. To become champion. No Items. Fox Only. Final Destination. By this point, each of your teams are down to their last member. Write a 1v1 to end the set and claim your crown. Whether your team selects a champion, or the rest have fallen, it comes down to this final match.

Man starts out on one side of the gym and the animal starts out on the other side of the gym aka man is starting off a few hundred feet away from the animal - must stay on the main gym floor so lockers rooms, pool, aerobics studios & storage closets are not available. Man has all gym floor equipment to use to defend themselves. Climate doesn't matter. Do you think in that scenario a human would have a better chance against a lion or against a polar bear?","You can hold your ground against a lion, and if you look threatening enough, it might decide that you're not worth the risk. Basically making the lion think you're dangerous prey. There's a chance of this failing, especially if the lion is hungry enough. I doubt this strategy will work against a polar bear.

We'll assume that both characters are within mid-game progression; \- Steve is still in his iron age with iron tools and armor & a decent bow/crossbow, averagely enchanted with basic enchantment levels, and only having been to the nether recently he could have a potion or two. May have a couple golden apples from crafting and/or loot chests. \- The Ark player is at level 40, probably has a longneck rifle with a few ammo, a few decent dino tames like a Triceratops, a pteranodon?, two raptors, three dodos. He is armored with Chitin. The level points are averagely distributed, with melee being a little more than the others, and minus the hunger & water points. We can take Steve's strength as canon being able to hold infinite mass, etc.., in case things got physical down to the knee while their tools got destroyed. Also we'll assume a proportionate amount of damage between the two i.e. if 20 heart points in Minecraft are 100 HP in Ark - then a Minecraft weapon that would normally take 5 hearts of damage, would deal 25 HP in Ark, this also applies to dinos' health and such. And vice-versa for Ark's weapons on Steve. Round 2: Both are still in their mid-game progression, but the players have a week to prepare still using mid-game tier tools. This is more open-ended and depending on the player's skill, but we can just assume someone with over 200 hours put into each game.","Ark guy stomps, iron armour sucks and Steve would not only be outranged but also outnumbered .

"argumenta sobre: The Imperium of Man, our space racists from Wh40k meet some teeny-tiny Earth Racists, the NazisWolfenstein, do they galactic-racists destroy or welcome the planetary-racists ? For this prompt we'll be using post-heresy Imperium in its current state, an effective corpse. For the Reich, we'll be using the one from WolfensteinMachinegames trilogy as its fairly advanced but not too OP either. As for our testing ground, that'll be a star system fairly similar to our own Solar system, but not an exact copy therefore it doesn't invite suspicion of chaos fuckery/illusions. Far away from Terra and Big E's disco light, there is a star system in the Drameara Nebula of Wh40k's Milky Way. This system houses a standard group of people, far away from chaos, xenos, and Imperium eyes, mostly keeping to itself. But due to warp shenanigans, these people lost their memories, and their memories get replaced with the ones of people from the exact year 1889, somehow, their tech also replaced to 1889 level, familiar nations such as America and the UK formed. WW1 happens as normal, these people continue to live just like back in terran history. But then happens WW2, the Nazi circus pops up, and like in the Wolfenstein games, they get access to Da'at YichudJewish secret society with really advanced tech vaults, reverse engineer stuff, and win the war, eventually conquer the world, making it a dystopia. Alongside earth, they now also control the Moon Base and Venus City with a deranged senile Hitler alive on Venus. Earth is controlled by an even worse dictator, Frau Engel. The Nazis have all their SupersoldatenHeavy servitor-esque soldiers Ubersoldatenfast fucks that can stick to walls Big floating armored city capable of tanking nukes Biggest boi with plasma weapons Titan-analogue and all other stuff from the games, enough to make them not just mere target practice. For orbital bombardment analogues, they have the Sonnegewehrbig fuck off lens in orbit Assume all the robots are made from tortured humans, to avoid the Avoid screaming Abominable Intelligence. Deathshead is alive too. The Imperium arrives around what is the 1970s, and sadly, no BJ Blackowicz exists. We're also gonna assume the Imperium's lower classes too have knowledge of ww2 and the holocaust in order to understand the new Nazis. After getting know to that Xenos and chaos exists via the Imperium, the Nazis are willing to put their aryan-supremacy bullshit just a bit behind, i.e. when they supply tithesif integrated, their soldiers would keep their hatred of non-aryans or queers to themselves, the racism remains within that weird nazi system too, at best they're a weird world which does supply tithes at normal and at worst they're heretics. The Nazi hate system also now includes anti-xenos/chaos hatred alongside its normal hatred. Their anti-xenos/chaos hatred rivals the Black Templars in this scenario. And should the Imperium present psykers, agree to the idea of Big E being the perfect Aryan, the Nazis will be willing to join the Imperium almost instantly afterall both are fascists. For anyone unfamiliar with wolfenstein and wanting a quick rundown of their Reich's thinking:Automated labo camps with essentially black and red colored nazi dreadnoughts for enforcement exist, and here is some in-universe propaganda posters for reference- Nazi Propaganda Secondary focus will be what the Imperium will do with the Nazi weaponry, the weaponized servitor soldiers, the design and architecture philosophy, floating cities like the Ausmerzer, etc. How will the sub-factions like Ecclesiarchy, Inquisition, High Lords and major surviving astartes legions react ? How might the Roboute-Cawl Ultramar political axis deal with these fascists ? If integrated into Imperial guard or other Imperium sub-factions, what names/nicknames might the black and red uniform wearing extra-hateful Nazi guardsmen earn ? Warfare/warfare capabilities are not the main focus of this prompt, the political interactions are. And I didn't really know what flair would be most suitable. Now lets come to the technical/warfare/guns part. If you want your astartes to have a ride. Wh40ks cybermastiffs are sure cool, but tiny, and rarely utilized by authors, so I give to you, the Panzerhund Assuming the design of the panzerhund remains the same, an APC/car sized heavily armored doggo with the brain of an actual dog in the head, a beefed up dog servitor mostly. Assuming Mechanicus brings it to Imperium standard via ceramite materials and makes it faster. Are we gonna see guardsmen or astartes in combat riding the flame-breathing doggies with maws capable of fetching cultists like a ball ?","A 8ft chiselled SM is a Nazi's wet dream no? They'll most probably be willingly integrated once they see the first SM, becoming a new regiment within the imperium haha."
"argumenta sobre: Can Earth Survive: Every Cell Phone is now a B1 Battle Droid. Every cell phone/smart phone has now poofed into a B1 Battle Droid they poof off to the side so that if there is a cell phone in someone's pocket, they dont explode from Droid spawn in. The Droids are blood lusted/lack self-preservation instincts but CANNOT use ranged weapons.

There are chairs and desks. Start on opposite ends of the classroom. Victory via incapacitation to the extent that there's no chance to fight back or outright death.

Edit: If 20 is a stomp, reduce the number of 5th graders to 10.","The problem with this scenario is that unless the kids are bloodlusted, there just isn't going to be a fight. Lethal force is not something the average person wants to resort to, nevermind the average 10 year old.

"argumenta sobre: Due to money troubles, the Kaminoans use a frozen human Captain America as the Clone Template. Meanwhile Dooku has found an AI to renovate the Droid Army with, codenamed Ultron. Now with the Cap Clone Army and Ultron Droid Separatists, who wins The Clone Wars? Prompt/Background Info TL;DR at bottom Jango Fett has realised he's in a prime bargaining position for the role of Kaminoan Clone Template, and has raised his price to an unsightly amount of Credits. The Kaminoans are unable to afford Fett's prices, and must pursue another option. Last week they recovered an escape pod in orbit marked ""Stark Industries"", and inside they found a cryogenic freezing pod with a human man within. The Kaminoans noted that the man was genetically enhanced, and if the thawing process were successful, he could prove to be an even greater template for the Kaminoans. Upon thawing, Cap is brought up to speed with where he is and his imminent role in the Republic should he agree, and he tentatively agrees to be the Clone Template and help train the Clones to overcome the Separatist threat. Meanwhile Count Dooku has arrived to inspect the subject and report back to Darth Sidious. After witnessing some admirable martial arts from Cap and his Clone Cadets, Dooku's curiosity is piqued by the Stark Industries escape pod. Attempting to learn more about Cap's origins, Dooku has a Tactical Droid access the system and open a prominent file named ""Ultron.exe"". The Droid spasms briefly before regaining it's composure, and proceeding to walk past Dooku. It has a different voice, and ignores Dooku's commands in lieu of striving to find ""more information"", nonchalantly accessing a Kaminoan data archive and quickly hacks its way into the galactic HoloNet. Dooku insists the droid follow his orders so he can report back to his master, Sidious, but the droid instead mutters ""Sidious... Vocal confirmation of identification in... Coruscant Senate, Chancellor's Office. Hmm."" and proceeds to display security footage of the Chancellor's Office into the room. Dooku ensures the room is empty, before deciding to observe his master's meeting with Mas Amedda. Sidious can clearly be heard discussing his upcoming plans for The Clone Wars, and how Dooku will be replaced with a corrupted Anakin Skywalker. Realising he'll be betrayed, Dooku decides to brand Sidious as a traitor to the Separatist cause leaving him blind to Dooku's plans and redevelop the droid army with the advanced AI Ultron leading the force and aiding in redevelopment. Differences from Canon The pre-Clone Wars events transpire as usual up until Zam Wessel is cornered at the bar, at which point Captain America appears to subdue her conducting his own mission for the Republic before Jango's dart kills Zam. Cap takes Obi-Wan back to Kamino to see the Cloning Program secretly ordered by the Chancellor in order to spur on the creation of the Republic Clone Army and shows him around. Jango appears on the Platforms and attempts to kill Obi-Wan, instead luring him to Geonosis a la Attack of the Clones. Meanwhile Ultron has been upgrading the Separatist forces using whatever information and resources he and Dooku can acquire, with Ultron only remaining loyal to Dooku to aid him in crushing the Republic. The Battle of Geonosis is the only set battle, with all other encounters being based on strategic value, resource claims and other tactical moves. Stipulations The Cap Army are identical to MCU's Captain America. They're armed with Phrik versions of Cap's shield, slugthrower pistols identical to Cap's M1911, DC-15A blaster rifle holstered on the back with/instead of shield and two thermal detonators. They're wearing a Plastoid weave version of Captain America's First Avenger uniform whereas Cap Prime wears a Cortosis-weave Winter Soldier variant. Cap Clones may however switch up their loadouts for specialised gear should the mission demand it. Cap leads the bulk of the training, but experienced pilots like Anakin Skywalker help train the Cap Clones in how to operate Star Wars vehicles proficiently prior to the Battle of Geonosis. The Ultron Droids focus more on Super Battle Droids as a base, however Ultron will be constantly adapting better technology and materials into the Droid Army over time as resources and information are obtained. For instance taking a Cortosis-rich planet may be a priority for the Separatists in order to reinforce the Ultron Droids, or Ultron may hold top weapons scientists hostage to finish working on equipment to enhance the Ultron Droids. Although Ultron starts off as a Tactical Droid, he quickly transfers himself over to an IG-100 Magnaguard unit before continuing to upgrade himself as per usual. As stated in the prompt, Sidious/Palpatine is cut off from Dooku and unable to puppeteer The Clone Wars. He must now defeat the Separatists legitimately with the GAR assisted by the Jedi as usual to complete his plan. 【Round One】: Cap army has morals on, and will be in-character such as ignoring orders if they put innocents at risk, or taking on risky rescue missions when not advisable. Ultron will be in-character but will still obey Dooku and anyone Dooku instructs to command Ultron such as Grievous or Admiral Trench. Victory achieved by surrender of other side, conquest of hostile territories, or elimination of enemy leadership Republic Senators + Jedi + Palpatine/Separatist Senators + Sith besides Sidious + Grievous. MCU versions. 【Round Two】: Cap army is bloodlusted, no morals. Collateral damage and civilian casualties are acceptable. Pyrrhic victory is still a victory. Once Ultron is superior to Dooku in combat, he will usurp control of the Separatist faction and aim to dominate the Galaxy. MCU versions for both. 【Round Three】: Same as last time, but 616 versions of both Cap and Ultron. Iron Man is present as technical adviso expert/backup for Cap and can help augment the GAR with Star Wars tech utilising suits and weaponry. Ultron starts off in the now fully mechanised body of Grievous, but also knows the locations of various suitable materials to upgrade himself and his army. Victory is by elimination only. Five year prep for Team Cap, two for Team Ultron. 【Bonus Round】: The Cap Army, Cap Prime and Iron Man have successfully aided the Republic in crushing Ultron's Droid Army. Palpatine has enacted Order 66 after Vader struck down Mace Windu, turning the Cap Clones against the Jedi. Can Cap Prime and Iron Man help the Jedi survive Order 66, or do the Cap Clones wipe out the Jedi? Cap Prime and Iron Man get a month's forewarning of an attack on the Jedi, but don't know that it's the Clones that will be carrying it out. TL;DR | Heading | TL;DR | |:-----------|------------:|:------------:| | Prompt |Captain America found by Kaminoans in escape pod and used in place of Jango Fett. Ultron also found onboard as software AI. Dooku discovers Sidious is going to betray him, and attempts to lead the Separatists to victory without Sidious pulling strings.| | Timeline | Episode II.

Victory by elimination, conquest of occupied worlds or surrender of enemy side. | Round 2| MCU Cap Clones and Prime bloodlusted, morals off. Pyrrhic victory acceptable to Caps and Republic. Ultron will usurp Dooku's position once strong enough. | Round 3| Same as above with 616 versions. Cap/Republic gets Tony Stark/Iron Man and 5 years prep. Ultron gets Grievous's body to start and 2 years prep. Elimination only victory. | Bonus| Cap Clones join Darth Vader to carry out Order 66. 616 Cap and Iron Man try to save the Jedi, and get a months prep cannot stop Order 66 or remove Clone Inhibitors, but can prep for a lengthy engagement and prepare evacuation plans. Think that about wraps it up. Hopefully this looks decently formatted when posted, but knowing my luck I'll have to tweak it. If you read the TL;DR and need more information, I'd suggest checking the longer rundown first in case I mentioned what you're looking for there. Otherwise, feel free to ask if you need clarification on anything! Edit: Fixed a broken link.","R1: I don't think that a subservient ultron would be able to improve the separatist manufacturing capacity in any meaningful way. He might be able to make some tweaks, but we need to recognize that the trade federation is a bunch of ruthless capitalists and technocrats. Sure it's possible to make better droids than the basic battle droids or even supers, magnaguards, and droideka's, but better droids require more resources and time to produce. Furthermore, making a change in the middle of a production run takes a shit ton of time. The reason mass production is such a big deal is that you're minimizing the extremely large overhead involved when you have to retool your entire production system. And we can presume that the capitalists and technocrats of the trade federation already have a near-optimal setup. But they're also proud and likely won't listen to Ultron's strategic advice as well as they should. So in this round all you really get out of ultron is better tactics and better aim. Maybe towards the end of the fight you get some marginally better droids, but not by much. Cap clones on the other hand are orders of magnitude better than Jango clones. Better speed, aim, durability, and with training from the cap they're likely better at tactics and working as a unit. And let's not forget that Jedi are not trained in the art of war. They're actually fairly mediocre generals. It never made sense for Jedi to lead the charge like they did, they're more effective as specialized shock troops. Now we get Captain America calling the shots I doubt the Jedi are too proud to accept his help, and with Palpatine salty about Duku's betrayal he won't cloud Yoda's force clairvoyance. I don't know the events of the clone wars well enough to go battle-by-battle, but R1 the republic gets a way bigger boost than the separatists. So 8 or 9/10 republic R2: idk. It really depends on how quickly ultron takes over. I think he could probably shoot duku in the back during an inspection, but if you're looking at single combat it might take a while. Duku's physicals are meh, but as soon as his force spidey sense gets tingling he won't hold back and might force-crush any but a highly advanced combat unit requiring months to years of work. Plus, Duku knows the rule of 2. He'll be hesitant to provide ultron with the resources to upgrade his own platform that much. After writing all that out, and with the disclaimer that I'm at a loss as to how much time/resources it'll take ultron to upgrade himself to duku-smashing levels, I'd guess that there's only a 2/10 chance ultron takes out duku fast enough to make a difference, giving him 4/10 for victory. R3: I'm not well versed in 616 lore. I know cap and iron man are way stronger than mcu so cap clones are better. A lot of this is determined by whether they know about ultron or not. If not, ultron optimizes the fuck out of everything and roflstomps. Cap-clones be damned, ultron creates the perfect military-industrial machine for wrecking cap clones. If they know about ultron but can't act against him until geonosis, idrk presumably stark comes up with some good countermeasures, but I don't see how they'd beat ultron. Even if every clone gets the best suit stark can give them, base-level weapons are so destructive I feel like ultron could deal with it. Maybe they make it 2/10. If they know about ultron and can act against him prior to geonosis, they can probably stop him from building up his forces as well as he would otherwise, giving them may be 5/10. R4: iron man and cap would not survive against 20 cap clones if they didn't know it'd be the clones. Jedi fare exactly as well as they do in the movies. Maybe if the cap's training gives them super-integrity and they refuse the order things go better, but that's outside the scope of the prompt."

It takes place on some random desert world and it's TO THE DEATHHHHH.

Harry is able to get into the air before the fight begins, so they're on an even footing. He has his wand but not his invisibility cloak.","Harry has crazy reaction times but green goblin fights spiderman who has even crazier reaction times. Glider and broom seem similar in terms of speed but the broom is more maneuverable. Harry is a bit more of a glass canon but he has spells that can negate Goblins armor. This one is pretty tough. It mainly comes down to who lands a hit first and what happens if expelliarmus hits Goblin, does it just rip out any weapons he is holding, would it force the suit and the glider to toss away all its weapons, would it try and rip the suit off Norman entirely? Harry can also apperate in order to reposition more easily, he could also just straight up stun lock Goblin if he gets close enough . I think I give this to Harry high diff like 6/10 times"

Three new students are dropped into the MHA Universe, and are coming to UA High School. However, this time around they're all 14 and younger, and they're now in class 1-A training to be top heroes. Instead of Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki coming to UA , these 3 replace them. They have to go through the same exact trouble the original monster trio did. The rest of the class stays the same Aang End of Original Series Ben 10No Ghostfreak, replaced with Cannonbolt, no Waybig Jake Long the American Dragon Conditions: 1. They are in character and have their normal equipment. They understand the basics of the universe Superheroes, quirks, All Might. Assume All Might is the same power level as post giving his quirk to Midoriya. 2. To make this interesting, everything stays the same, but Aang has guidance from All Might but doesn't get the quirk takes on Midoriya's battle path, Ben 10 takes on Bakugo's path, and Jake Long takes on Todoroki's. However, they influence how other events in the story go based off how they perform. For example, they can help fight Nomu before All Might comes if you think they can beat him. 3. Assume Aang can't go into avatar state at will But can as a defense mechanism in serious life threatening situations. He can't take peoples quirks away. 4. Ben starts off with only his original 10 Aliens and. has limited master control. He can do multiple transformations, for a combined time of 10 minutes max per activation period. After those 10 minutes are up, Ben turns back to normal and has a 5 minute recharge time before being able to use another alien. Also, the more transformations he does during that 10 minute time period leaves him with less maximum time, 2 leaves him with 8 minutes, 3 leaves him with 5, 4 leaves him with 3. 4 is the max. Ben is aware of this time limit 5. To clarify, if Ben 10 had used 2 transformations in the span of 4 minutes, then transformed for a 3rd time, he'd have 1 minutes left before his recharge period. If he tried to transform to his 3rd alien at the 7 minute mark, he'd instantly go into recharge mode. 6. Jake Long has full control of his Dragon transformation and abilities, although he keeps his left ear and underbelly weakness. Those weaknesses are unknown to everyone but him. Saga 1: Aang is Book 1 level for rounds 1-2. Aang is Book 2 level for Rounds 3-4. 1. Can Aang and Ben 10 pass the entrance exam? Assume Jake Long gets in through recommendation.

At this point, Ben now has every alien he had from the original series, except for Waybig. He still has his limitations. Aang is now Book 3 level, but before seeking the Sun Warriors and becoming a better fire bender, for rounds 1-2. Aang is end of Book 3 level for the rest of the rounds. Saga 6: 1.

"argumenta sobre: Can Frieza close the Eye of terror WH40k Frieza is teleported into the wh40k universe, and all of a sudden, every single tidbit of information currently present in the Warhammer wiki is beamed into his brain. His objective, close the eye of terror in the Segmentum Obscurus by any means necessary. He is given a century to do so, and failure to close it in time will lead to him being sucked into the warp for all eternity, and if he succeeds he is immediately transported back into his universe. During the duration of his objective, he will not age at all and cannot die from natural causes, but is able to die from any diseases that he can't handle. Also, he can't just annihilate everyone in the galaxy and call it quits. Round 1: Frieza is transported alone. Round 2: The Frieza force soldiers, scientists, engineers, other support staff alongside their mobile assets spaceships, attack pods, space stations are transported alongside him, and are similarly given immortality for the duration of the objective.","I don't really think the DBverse kind of gives him a way of properly interacting with the Eye of Terror, or its source. We know 40k itself possesses technology as to who might Necrons, but Frieza and by extension the Frieza Force probably are interacting with a scientific branch they don't have much interaction with. That said I think if he's literally immortal, the only thing that really stops him is getting ganked by a Psyker. He might be able to swing it in Round 2 as we know the Frieza Force does take all comers i.e Frieza is ironically one of the less xenophobic forces in the WH40k setting. I think Round 1 is probably not because Frieza's chances of getting ganked is way higher without just disposable bodies to test the waters of the setting for him. Round 2 is leaning on yes, but still very hard since he now has actually a massive scientific backing and from what we understand, the Frieza Force does bring a ton of things like FTL and PFP power to the setting in droves."

argumenta sobre: A crab the size of Germany spawns in the middle of the ocean. It's located at the very bottom of the sea floor and it's not breaching the surface. What would happen if it woke up? Pretty self explanatory from the title but I'll add a bonus Round for funzies. Bonus Round: The humans have to kill the crab without using nuclear weaponry or bombs over 1000 kilograms. Can they manage? Edit: we are gonna ignore starvation and that kind of stuff because it very much just isn't fun. Edit 2: people took this post as a humanity VS a giant crab when all I really wanted to know what would happen if it spawned in the ocean and woke up. The bonus Round is humanity vs giant crab but not the whole post itself.,"Assuming a fairly normal crab like a shore crab, 'The size of Germany' means that it's 500km wide including legs, 200km long, which means it's about 100km tall when stood normally. So, it looms over the ocean. Sorry, there's no way to achieve your 'not breaching the surface' condition without making it an order of magnitude or two smaller! The top of it's shell is in the upper atmosphere we'll ignore temperature and oxygen issues. The bottom is still tens of km in the air. The feet are themselves ten km across at the tip and create craters a km deep every time they're placed. It's tall enough that, with it's eyes that are each 10km in diameter, it can perceive the curvature of the earth and the generalities of landmasses. It can't see anything on a human scale however, it's just too massive. Even stationary, this thing will have some insane effects on the atmosphere and weather systems. I'd imagine that it causes immense rains in its proximity, and probably high winds. Think the impact the Himalayas have on global weather patterns. It'll effect ocean currents also - lack of sunlight on the ocean beneath it will cause cooling and immense die offs of animals and plants which rely on sunlight. More complex animals may struggle to navigate or orient without sun and moonlight. If it moves? Shit. Conservatively it can move at 100km per second scaling against number of bodylengths per second normal crabs can move. Every time it puts a limb down the footprint is 10km wide; on solid ground it'll probably penetrate a km downwards. Which means 80-ish cubic km of material is disturbed with every step. Most of it will be violently displaced laterally. This thing won't quite be creating mountains with every step, but it will be creating enormous craters. On water it's even worse. In open ocean each step displaces a column of water of 314km^3 assuming 4km ocean depth - it'll be greater or less in places where ocean is deeper or shallower respectively. To put it another way, in 10 steps our behemoth crab will have moved as much material as the Storegga Slide That event reshaped the coastline of northern Europe, quite possibly hastened the creation the English Channel, and wiped out whole populations of mesolithic humans. It's suggested that nowadays a 500km^3 displacement could create a tsunami which would kill millions. That's of course forgetting about direct earthquake effects, which are likely to be severe given this thing will be taking many steps per second. Also, when this thing moves it's displacing literally millions of cubic kilometres of air. Given how fast it's moving it'll create a truly insane pressure front in front of it, and a vacuum behind it. We're talking far beyond hurricanes here - it'll probably create massive tornado effects around and beneath it's body, and beyond hurricane force winds for tens of km around it. Storm winds for hundreds if not thousands. Also, it's going to force air to different altitudes so there will be effects on temperature and precipitation. So yeah, the minute this thing starts moving it triggers a rolling localised apocalypse against which there is no defence. If humanity survives anywhere it'll be in the centre of the larger continents, but only if the thing decides it doesn't want to walk there. No, we can't kill it without nukes. We possibly can't kill it with nukes."

argumenta sobre: A man with a katana vs. a man with sword and shield vs. a man with a spear vs. a man with a bow - Katana - Sword and shield - Spear - Bow with 5 arrows Four perfectly identical humans fight to the death in a coliseum arena. Starting distance is 3 meters. Round 1: They are given 5 minutes to train with their weapons. Round 2: They are given 1 year to train with their weapons. Who comes out alive?,R1: The spear is the easiest for someone with no experience to use so I give it to the spear guy R2: either sword and shield or spear. Small distance screws the bowman and I'd guarantee someone targets him right away. Katana is at a disadvantage against the spearman and sword and shield guy defense wise. Depends on how the latter makes use of his defense. This is giving the sword and shield guy an actual small sword and buckler and archer a good bow because what's shown in the pictures would be awful to use

argumenta sobre: Aragorn Lord of the Rings and Jaime Lannister A song of Ice and Fire switch places. Who does better? Aragorn wakes up in King's Landing while Jaime Lannister appears at the Prancing Pony. They are seen as the character they replaced by outsiders and they have the memories of the character they replaced in addition to their own. They retain their equipment and physique. &x200B; Who gets farther? Will Jaime Lannister fight off the orcs and help defeat Sauron? Will Aragorn get caught by the Starks or fend off the White Walkers?,"Is this a spite match? Jaime is a hilariously bad person, like I know his chapters are fun to read but he's literally psychopathic. He seizes the Ring by force on the first or second day, easy. And Aragorn's most startling power is his supernatural charisma. People who have only just met him in dubious circumstances are instantly awed by his appearance and swiftly go to taking orders from him over the course of a single conversation. He could easily bloodlessly unite Westeros."
"argumenta sobre: All Earth's species gain human level intelligence. Who wins out and becomes Earth's dominant species? Sorry if this has been done before. Just discovered the sub and have wondered this for a while. Round 1: We don't include plants, fungi or microscopic organisms such as bacteria, protozoa ECT. No viruses of course Round 2: We open it up, everything. Still no viruses","Humans. Because we got here first and have spent tens of thousands of years developing the things we have, the things our intelligence lets us use. Let's start with the realistic impact, and then move on to why the animals still lose. Any animal that is too small to support a human level intelligence dies. Any animal that is large enough but not able to get enough food to sustain such a brain, dies. Any animal that survives this stage begins aquiring manias, depression, and/or disorders, with zero psychological help available. This is what would happen in reality. Let us now bypass the realities of granting all living things human intelligence, and move on to the logistical challenge. Communication. Before cooperation needs to come communication. Language must be developed, and it won't just be one language per group. Every pride of lions, pack of wolves, flock of sheep, herd of elephants, mound of ants, these groups will all develop their own language that is incompatable with each other. This leads to infighting, and lots of it. We know this is true because tribal communities demonstrate it. The supposed dominance of eusocial communities is destroyed by this simple fact. Tool use. The single biggest advantage we have. Only apes can hope to weild our tools in anything approaching an effective manner, and there are too few apes to take over the world, excepting humanity. Everything else has to invent tool use, then tools, then refinement, then more tools. The animals must progress up the tech tree same as we did, only mostly without any form of grasping. Only things with two hands and thumbs are anything approaching successful in this category. Logistics. Humanity can move bodies and supplies at speeds and in number that no nonhuman revolt can match. We have the food premade to feed our armies. Animals must forage or hunt wherever they go. Weapons. The most important part of tool use is weapons. And nothing an animal can invent in the short time before humans figure out what's happened is countering the gun. Bonus round: anything that lacks the capability of basic communication beyond sending instinctual chemical signals is thoroughly hosed. Microorganisms may never realize what they live on, or if they do, they worship it as a god. Remember, human level intelligence includes believing in some pretty wild things. Plants are just fucked. Like, more fucked than the microorganisms. They have zero ability to actively do anything. Everything is passive with plants. They also have a human level intellect permanently trapped in a sensory deprivation chamber. The plants could be easy contenders for 'literally of them go mad'."
"argumenta sobre: The trinity of wholesome, Bob Ross, Steve Irwin, and of course Mr. Rogers all end up in the Infinity War universe. Can they convince Thanos to not follow through with the snap? Pretend the trinity has known each other for years and work together very well. Thanos knows they exist, but has never seen any of their shows or has been impacted by them in any way so far. Thanos also cannot kill, maim, or harm any of the trinity in any way. He can attack them, but it just won't do anything and they are not affected by any of the stones. Thanos also does not know and can not prepare for the three of them to show up. Thanos will know about the trinity after the first encounter round 1 and the trinity can build upon each encounter with Thanos. Be sure to account for each of the Avengers in area that they'll be present. The trinity may have to de-escalate the Avengers as well. Round 1: The group finds Thanos before he has a chance to attack Thor's ship. Round 2: On Titan, in the middle of the ambush. Round 3: Wakanda, after the battle but before Vision has his stone taken and Thor appears and throws Stormbreaker. Edit: I've read all of the comments and I see the underlying theme of murdering Gamora. So I propose a round 4: Instead of Red Skull approaching Thanos about the stone, it's the trinity. And how about a bonus round: Thanos now DID grow up watching all the shows - and following along with Bob Ross's paintings. Can they affect him now?","Never. It isn't as though Thanos wants to do it. He isn't driven by a desire for power, to be a god or even status. He threw his daughter, the only being in the universe that he loved, off of a cliff. He is dedicated to the cause because he isn't doing it for himself. This comes down to how Thanos sees himself. This fucker believes that he is the one and only being that truly knows what's best for the universe and that everyone else is either misguided or wrong and he accepts the fact that he'll be hated for what he's doing and he's ok with it. He is willing to sacrifice everything he has, everyone he loves, and be hated by the universe because he KNOWS that what he's doing is right. He has accepted that he's the savior. That he'll be crucified and will do it regardless. He's heard what the trinity will say millions of times. His own daughter has tried to talk him out of him. He will never budge. it isn't as though there is no other way, there is, but Thanos is too close minded to see it. He lost his homeworld and that caused him to have this pathological desire to bring his personal vision down on the the rest of the universe regardless of who stands in his way. He will respect the three. He may even spare them I certainly doubt Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross wouldn't try and stop him but he will think they're weak hearted and wrong. He will hope that the earth remembers them and uses them as role models in the future but thats it."

If you know all the lore he's definitely got small knives at least not sure if we are counting his collection of medieval weapons as standard equipment and is extremely fit.

Everyone is in-character. That means IW Thanos won't be one-shotting people with the Reality Stone. 2. Doctor Strange is not allowed to use the Time Stone, nor is anyone else who takes it. Any other Stone can be used by anyone who possesses it as long as their use of it is in-character. 3. Anybody with the ability to one-shot a planet IW Thanos, possibly Surtur, and anyone who gets their hands on the Power Stone is not allowed to do so. 4. Everyone on each team will cooperate to achieve that team's objectives, even if they don't match their actual motives from the films or if they have to work with characters they normally wouldn't be compatible with. 5. Each team is aware of every other team's motivations. 6. BFR is not allowed unless it kills the subject in the process so getting punched into orbit would count in some cases but Thanos can't teleport the other armies into another solar system. The in-character rule applies here too, of course. 7. A team can only win if a its objectives are met and b the objectives of the other two teams are permanently prevented from being met. 8. The team leaders of both opposing teams must be killed before a team claims victory. However, a team's leader does not have to remain alive for it to claim victory. Every team is aware of the identity of every other team's leader. 9. All forces on the surface of the planet start within 500 meters of Ego's palace from GOTG Vol. 2. All forces in the atmosphere must start directly above their ground forces. All forces in space start within fifteen kilometers of a point in low orbit above the center of Ego's palace. 10. Space forces may enter the atmosphere to assist planetary forces during the battle, and vice versa if possible.","It's difficult to say in terms of numbers which team has the most soldiers according to your list, however if they were fighting all together than I procur that there will be total mayham. In terms of strength I have to say that all the villians in Team 3 seem to have a higher chance of winning than the other two, however if they fight unorganized then any team could win. It just takes one hero from Nova Corp or Loki to defeat Ego, Captain America and Hulk can take out Thanos without the stones, and if the various armies aren't held back, then laser beams could annihilate pretty much every hero without defense against them."

They don't have to kill the dragon but will get extra points for doing so. Round 2: Each hero has to rescue their sidekick from the lake.

If the hero cannot survive underwater, it is up to them and their sidekick to figure out how to prior to the challenge. Round 3: The heroes are all dropped into the maze and are in a race to find the cup with their sidekick still guiding them. They must stick to the maze and cannot just jump/fly over it.

Thor: Sends his weapon flying at the dragon killing it near instantly and takes the egg. Black Panther: Has a long battle with the dragon mostly dodging and running from it for him to slay the beast with a few good blows at the neck and then he takes the egg. Captain America: Has a Long battle of running away and using his shield to fight the dragon and then he finally grabs the egg. Ant Man: He goes super sized and then stamps on the dragon and then takes the egg.

"argumenta sobre: Can a dnd party of 4 lvl20 players save constantinople in 1453? They know in advance what they will be facing, and can optimize their class, build and item. The byzantine authority will cooperate with the party. And support them however they can. The ottoman will be informed that constantinople will receive a certain special aid, and it is a divine test for them to prove themselves for one last time. So they will not retreat or give up the siege no matter what.","I would point out that D&D is not great at dealing with war levels of forces. It doesn't take a lot of digging to find scenarios where serious threats are rolling around and Level 20 characters just let it happen or don't care. This is the Ottomans' best shot, and a serious one, that the Level 20 party decides to go muck around in Japan instead of worrying about Byzantium. That said, if we assume that the D&D party is utterly committed to Byzantium as opposed to aware of the quest and questionably motivated, there are several things that could work. Time Stop + Assassinating Mehmed II + Epic Cheese manipulation could simply throw the Ottomans into complete confusion and break off the attack. Control Weather, to turn the siege into a brutal winter that kills the attacker, is another viable option Another route of attack is the idea of a 'Wight Bomb', the means to create a mid level undead that can create more of itself, then cause breakouts of Wights to start emerging in Ottoman lines. The list of undead that can be used to Wight Bomb is long and includes far nastier choices than Wights, like Wraiths, Vampires and Bodaks; given the resources of the party, it's even possible to start deploying superdudes like Lavawights and WInterwights for truly terrifying destroy the Ottoman Army with overwhelmingly dangerous foes. Finally, the actual battle involved breaching the walls with the Guns of Urban. Taking out those guns and stopping the Ottoman breakthrough is probably the easiest option, in terms of combat power. /// The Byzantines had better be ready to pay for a second mortgage on everything, since this question is going to boil down to whether they can motivate the 20th level characters."

Your average American high school in Smalltown U.SA has just discovered that in precisely one week, the school will be attacked by a T. Rex. Everyone in the school must figure out a way to work together to fight it off with only the people and equipment they have with them. No one can leave and no one can enter the school until the T. Rex has arrived and either died or killed everyone. So with the materials and average intellect found in this high school, is it enough to defeat the T.

"argumenta sobre: You must fight Batman. You get to choose any one power for yourself for the fight. However, Batman gets to ask 20 yes/no questions to try and determine what power you have. If he guesses it, you lose the power and you have to fight him barehanded. What power can let you win? Rules: - Batman/Bruce will simply be in his underwear with no weapons or armor. You can wear your regular street clothes if you like. - To avoid him instantly speedblitzing you, you start at opposite ends of a football field. - He can ask any question he wants, and will be doing his best to whittle down entire categories by asking things like ""will it let you hit me from a distance?"" or ""will it affect my ability to perceive you?"" or ""if a 10-year old had this power, is there a reasonable chance that YOU could beat him?"". - He gets 3 minutes to prepare a strategy before asking the first question, then 30 seconds after your answers to ask each additional question. - His guess needs to be pretty close, but it doesn't have to be exact. He needs to have the basic ideas behind your powers down, but doesn't need to have the exact incidental details. If you choose ""Spawning 143 northeastern bald faced hornets per second out of my left hand"" as your power, and he guesses that you can summon or generate stinging insects, that's a win for him. - If he doesn't get your power within 20 guesses, his memory of the conversation will be erased to keep him from deducing which powers you do or don't have, and all he'll know is that he needs to incapacitate you. - Should go without saying, but you have to answer honestly.

"argumenta sobre: How would Infinity War go if the Avengers had failed in every previous movie with an infinity stone? So say Thanos gets to Infinity War but instead of how it plays out here the Avengers have been shit at their jobs the whole time. That means: - Captain America actually dies and fails to stop Red Skull and Nazis take over the world and develop weapons up until the events of the first Avengers movie using the Tesseract. - Nazi Avengers and a very conflicted Thor stop the Chitauri and obtain the Mind Stone which Hydra uses. Thor takes the Tesseract to Asgard but not the Mind Stone as he doesn't realize what the Mind Stone is. - Thor fails to stop Malekith from obtaining the Aether as he has no feelings for Nazi Jane Foster. Malekith leaves for space with the Aether and his dark elves. - The Guardians of the Galaxy fails to stop Ronan because Cap let Nazies take over the world and Footloose was never made. Quill doesn't distract Ronan with a dance-off and Ronan obliterates Nova Prime. Ronan rules over the Kree with the Power Stone. - Cap is dead and unable to distract Ultron so Ultron manages to get uploaded into Vision fully with the Mind Stone. Nazi Avengers manages to semi-stop Sokovia but is unable to stop Vision-Ultron. Half the human race is wiped out. Vision-Ultron eventually happens upon Wakanda and creates more Ultron bots with vibranium. Wakanda is not completely wiped out as they have their vibranium dampeners but cannot take out Ultron either. They end up in a deadlock. - Doctor Strange never thinks to look at the mystic arts in this Nazi-fied world. Kaecilius takes over the Ancient's position with Dormammu's help but instead of releasing Dormammu he uses the Time Stone to bring back his family. He keeps the Time Stone and leads the Masters of the Mystic Arts. - Thor is unable to stop Hela and is killed. Hela uses the Tesseract that Thor brought home and leads her undead Asgardian army from Asgard. Ragnarok does not come to pass. - Gamora is never led away by Quill and eventually gives up the location of the Soul Stone to Thanos who sacrifices her and starts off with that one stone. So now Thanos has only the Soul Stone. He faces Malekith with aether, Hela with the tesseract, Ronan with the power stone, Kaecilius with the time stone, and Ultron with the mind stone. This along with their respective armies. Thanos has the Chitauri and his suicidal army as well as his Black Order. Round 1 - Thanos has to get the stones in the order he does in the movie. So power stone to tesseract to aether to time stone to mind stone. Can he do it? Round 2 - Thanos needs all six but he can go in whatever order works best. Round 3 - All six stone bearers want to assemble the gauntlet. Who has the best chance of taking out the other five and obtaining all six stones?","Ultron definitely has the best chance of obtaining all the stones in a free-for-all. In a single week he was capable of putting together an army that was almost a match for the avengers, and with the Wakandan vibranium reserves he'd be able to create hundreds or thousands of vision-level bodies, albeit only one with the mind stone. With years of prep time to consolidate the world's resources and expand his production he'd have the strongest army by far, and be nearly unkillable to boot without an AI like Jarvis to purge him from the internet. Plus, he's the only one of the group who might be immune to the soul stone. Hela is the strongest of the group in a direct fight but is unfortunately tied to Asgard. Thanos beats up Ronan and Ultron either obtains the time stone from Kacelius or drives him into hiding in the mirror dimension. Ultron, upon discovering magic, may be able to force some sorcerers on threat of death to work for him and let his army into the mirror dimension to pursue Kacelius, so let's assume he gets the time stone. Malekith's grudge against the Asgardians leads him into conflict with Hela, in which he is defeated. This leaves Ultron, Thanos, and Hela with two stones each. Hela is bound to Asgard, which forces her to be perpetually on the defensive. Ultron repels Thanos's invasion and obtains space tech from the Kree/Chitauri. Leading his new intergalactic Von Neumann probe fleet, four of the six infinity stones in hand, he has as long as he wants to wear down Hela and make grabs at the remaining two stones."
"argumenta sobre: Harry Potter, but everyone tells Harry the truth from the beginning. 1. As soon as he's able to understand it, Petunia and Vernon tells Harry about how his parents died and of the magic world, as much as they know about it anyway. They let Harry express his magic without restrictions. 2. A few years later, Dumbledore himself visits Harry, tells him about Hogwarts, about Voldemort, Sirius Black, Harry's mother's sacrifice, and whatever he knows about horrokruxes at the time. 3. At age 11, Harry is accepted at Hogwarts. Hagrid helps him with everything just as in the first book. When asked about the philosopher's stone, Hagrid explains everything he knows about it. He meets Hermione and Ron in an ordinary fashion. 4. When arriving at Hogwarts he meets Dumbledore again, who explains everything he knows again, just to be sure. He also tells Harry about Snape. 5. When the event of the third book occurs, Lupin tells Harry about him being a werewolf at their first patronus class. When shown the Marauder's Map, he tells Harry about Sirius, James Potter, Wormtail and of how Wormtail betrayed them. Also about how a grown ass man has lived in Ron's room for a century. 6. When Dumbledore learns something new about the Horrocruxes, he immediately tells Harry. 7. Dumbledore is killed by Snape, but Dumbledore and Snape have had a conversation with Harry about it earlier. If I missed any crucial point somewhere, the premise here is that no one lies to Harry about anything and tells him about everything they know of importance, as soon as they can. Can he still defeat Voldemort in the end?","I don't know that too much changed, but I want to point out that Lupin is honest about wormtail with Harry. He's just wrong. Lupin and Harry both learn the truth of that situation together. The only thing that it think might change about this is if Harry had grown up hearing about Sirius being the one who betrayed his parents rather than only learning of it that year he might have a more deep seeded hatred of Sirius and be less likely to listen to him."

Now Bond finds himself hunted by the High Table, the secretive council that controls the assassin world. How do you think Bond would handle this? Could his spy skills and gadgets give him an edge or would the High Table's assassins overwhelm him? For this scenario, the Bond in question, is Timothy Dalton's version, reimagined as a 28-year-old MI6 agent who has been trained by both Gene Lebell and Jean Claude Van Damme, with special expertise in disappearing without a trace. Oh, and Dalton's Bond is armed with Q branch technology plus a Walther PPK that is only tailored to his fingerprint.","Bond survives hands down, but he doesn't kill Wick. Wick survives to fight another day. But Bond destroys a hotel that is part of the Continental but never all or most of the chain. Same with the High Table. He might take out someone sitting at the table but never everyone or the organization or concept. And because in a world where the High Table has bullet proof suits, Q would step up to create tech that is above the average. Like bullet proof lotion, hairspray or some nonsense that impractical but always works in Bonds favor in the moment. Like the coach trap that could keep Wick at bay while Bond kills lesser assassins. Or his stun gas that would incapacitate Wick while bond moves on. In essence the High Table and Wick would be like the USSR/KGB in Bond films."

Possible access to C4 or something of the sort. rifle team will have 15 men 3 Machine gunners, fire team leader, 3 greniders 6 rifle men. I personally think marines take the 2 with ease and 3/4 times will win the first fight as well but i think the swat team will do much better in the house raid probably winning 75 percent or higher.","SWAT takes 1 and 3 most of the time, with 2 probably going slightly in the marines favor. Swat's main advantage is training and experience. I think you are seriously underestimating swat teams. We'll use LAPD D Platoon as an example. They are deployed on average every 3-4 days. Whenever their unit is not on call rotation, they are training continuously, and exclusively in marksmanship, team coordination, and tactical drills. Their marksmanship standards are also significantly more stringent than marines. Large city swat teams are more in line with special forces squads than standard rifle squads. They would have significantly more experience and training than the rifle squad."

I could see him having to deal with some low-tier and mid-tier supes while doing so, but as long as he has accurate intelligence on who he's dealing with, that's his bread and butter. The unknowns are the real danger here for Frank; you never know what kind of basement monsters Vought are keeping chained up for emergencies. He would delay any direct confrontation with the higher-tier supes until he's done as much damage as possible to their support network. He wouldn't tackle Homelander at all without a plan with a decently high chance of success. Would he come up with that plan faster than Billy Butcher? That comes down to whether or not you think Butcher has just been treading water and letting Homelander live to maintain a kind of psychosexual status quo, a-la Batman and the Joker.

For more than a hundred centuries... wait, nevermind, that's changed. Every single Imperium planet magically disappears. Instead, the United Federation of Planets from Star Trek shows up, with the whole shebang: planets, space stations, fleets, named characters, etc The Federation is as of 2363, aka the year Picard becomes captain of the Enterprise-D. The 40k Galaxy is as of the end of the Plague Wars. Note that Federation space is much smaller than the Imperium was. Nobody gains any automatic knowledge of anyone else. The Federation must figure out the situation by themselves, and all other factions must do the same with the Federation. Star Trek style Warp travel works as normal, except it doesn't work through 40k-style Warp storms. Notably this means crossing the Cicatrix is a challenge. Federation races are as subject to Chaos and the other horrors of the 40k galaxy as anyone else. Importantly this means Federation races can start to see psykers emerging, with all that entails. Diplomacy can unfold without any special limitations, but every faction is in character aka Chaos won't suddenly start being benevolent because Picard gave them a talking to. Goals To win the scenario, the Federation must: - survive - not renounce its fundamental principles aka not turn into the Imperium - eliminate or otherwise neutralise the major irreducible threats, like Chaos, Orks and Tyranids Can they do it? if they can, how long does it take them?","Star trek loses 10/10. We could argue the power of ships, industry, etc, but that doesn't really matter. Two factors decide this before it even starts. 1 starfleet is much smaller than the IOM. Their peak was around 30k ships during the dominion war. Hard numbers are difficult to come by for the IOM, but we can do some vary basic napkin math to get a rough idea. A space marine chapter will typically have at least 1 battle barge, 2-3 strike cruisers, and a handful of escorts which are 1-2km long. There are 1k chapters give or take so that leaves us with 1k battle barge, 2000-3000 strike cruisers, and probably around 4000-5000 escorts, putting the Astartes fleet at around 7000-9000 ships. Some chapters will have more ships, others will have less due to losses so this is a rough estimate. The Navy dwarfs the Astartes, and the Admech also has their own fleets. So the IOM should absolutely dwarf the federation in numbers and tonnage and we still have numerous situations where the IOM cannot dedicate enough ships to put out every fire. 2 ST FTL is slow. Like really slow. It is more reliable than 40k FTL, but we have seen plenty of issues with the warp drive on ST as well. This leads to ST being slower to react or possible unable to react at all, to major threats. If a hive fleet attacks in the delta sector and the majority of the federation fleet is in the alpha/beta sectors it could take 70 years for the federation to react. Now ST warp showings are a bit inconsistent, with navigating the federation in DS9 being something that should take 3 months. Regardless, their FTL is going to be slow and prevent them from properly reacting, so they won't be able to both go on the offense, and defend their own territory. There are numerous other reasons why they would lose this prompt, but I think those two really put the nail in the coffin"
"argumenta sobre: Would civilization survive if 10,000 megaladons suddenly appeared in the world's oceans? Megaladons suddenly start appearing showing up on crowded beaches, attacking fishing boats, etc. There are 10,000 of them, although we don't initially don't have this information - just that there seem to be a lot of them. Would civilization be able to survive the ecological impact as well as the impact on fishing, trade, and tourism? Could we hunt them all down? Would they devastate the global ocean supply of fish? If 10,000 is too many/too few then what's the most we could handle?","Hard to say ecologically, but they aren't exactly indestructible. They're about 3 times as long as a great white, and maybe about the length of a school bus. They don't have armor or anything. Ships could kill them without too much issue, the same ways we once hunted and killed whales. And blue whales are much bigger Their teeth are weaker than steel, so they'd probably have to try pushing boats over rather than bitting them. Sure, a few people would die. But, there's about 5,000 Great Whites right now, in the same kind of areas. Honestly? The biggest question would be the ecological ones, because that's not a stable population, and they're an invasive species. They'd probably mostly die out from hunger initially, before finding a stable equilibrium. I'm gonna be honest, civilization isn't in danger no matter how many you add, unless you just add enough to where they spill onto land. Cargo vessels would just be too big to be threatened. The largest megalodon was the 60 foot long one the size of a school bus. A typical container ship is well over 1200 feet global shipping lines wouldn't even be threatened. Civilization doesn't collapse without beach pleasure, so there's just no threat, outside of literally killing everything in the oceans and causing dietary changes."

Upon discovering that the game's creators intend to kill people deemed unfit to live by losing, he decides to shut the game down. His main goal is to take down the Front Man, AKA Hwang In-ho 황인호. Can Punisher shut down the Squid Games for good? Breakdown of the combatants: The Front Man has under his command guards who eliminate people who lose each of the rounds in Squid Game. He has a handgun. Punisher is a former US Marine turned vigilante. He starts the fight without any weapons. Key questions: According to MCU lore, how many rounds of Squid Game could Punisher last? How many rounds would Punisher HAVE to survive in order to even remotely get a chance of destroying the Front Man? Rules: Punisher isn't allowed to kill any fellow players The other players can die; Punisher just can't be their cause of death. The guards, however, are fair game.

No prep, just instincts. Who's walking away and why? Would Bourne's spy training outdo Wick's assassin skills? Or does Wick's pure focus and precision give him the edge? Curious to hear what you all think.",Wick has super human durability and is a better fighter than Bourne. I think master spy and master assassin cancel one another out in terms of stealth. Also Wick probably has his bulletproof suit so he has all of the advantages. Bournes only real chance are explosives and poisons. That being said Wick has no reason to attack Bourne unless JB was trying to apprehend him.

He can punch people in the face, walk with the ball, grab people around the waist etc. Coaches are aware of his talent/ability, and will deploy it strategically. Does he make the NBA? Does he get playing time? Is he in DPOY contention?","In my opinion, yes. Because Coaches are aware of it, they would just make a contract with him for large amounts of money and then train him to be competent at basketball. Of course he won't be as good as those that have trained for most of their lives, nor would he be as high for potential as those that are tall enough for NBA. But he would be good enough to make baskets at least, and draw out one directional fouls. If he pushes into someone else aggressively and they push back enough, they would get a foul and he may get free throws. No matter how aggressive. His only real limitation is stamina."

Strange gets all his gear from the mcu, ie sling ring, cloak of levitation and eye of agamotto and is at his infinity war or endgame level.

R3: Strange must train core trio, hermonie, ron and harry. To capable of facing voldermort and kaecilius within 24 hours. In thus round strange can use the time stone.","Pretty sure Strange kicks the crap out of any enemies he meets and if he can train the students, they're going to kick the crap out of any standard HP universe wizards.

What most ppl don't realize about Sion is that he wasn't just a brute with immortality, he was actually extremely competent as a sith lord and really powerful. The immortality-held-together-by-rage thing is just a hax that keeps him from being permanently killed. But based off what we know in the lore, darth bane outstats him in lightsaber dueling and fighting skill and has near-indestructible obelisk armor and has really strong force feats so it'd be close between him and sion. Traya would stomp zannah no-very low diff: she's got high in-verse scaling to compete with legends like Darth Malak, Darth Sion and even Darth Revan if you wanna use that arguments from the revan novelization. Traya would godstomp zannah: she has foresight and can see into the future, has way too many abilities and hax for zannah to counter.

Massive guys who are about as strong and aggressive as humans can get, wearing armor. Beyond that, football as a sport bears the strongest resemblance to organized combat. The other relevant sports are all about putting a ball in a basket, a puck in to a net, or hitting a ball with a bat. Football is about lining up as a team and beating the shit out of the guys across from you, with your hands. It's a pitched battle. I think the toughest test would be MLB players with their bats, but even the second scenario with even numbers means the NFL has a huge size advantage as they could just send out the 100 meanest lineman.

"argumenta sobre: How many Stormtroopers Star Wars would it take to kill a Space Marine Warhammer Rules: the regular Space Marine will be an Ultramarine, The stormtroopers will be given their E-11 blaster rifles but not their thermal detonators because then it's just whoever can get a lucky throw in, no outside help, and both sides are I character Round 1: Stormtroopers vs An unarmed Space Marine with no armor Round 2: Stormtroopers vs An unarmed Space Marine in armor Round 3: Stormtroopers vs An armored Space Marine with a Bolter and a Chainsword Round 4: Stormtroopers vs An armored Space Marine with a Melta gun and a Power Sword Bonus Round: Stormtroopers with thermal detonators vs A Custodes with all his normal gear","I'm gonna high ball it simply because of the near insane modifications done to a space marine; but an unarmed Space Marine with no armor would simply, probably, still be faster than the Stormtroopers; he'd just close the gap and start smashing. You'd need a full platoon, possibly two to guarantee the Astartes dies. Once you get the Astartes in his power armor it's over. It's incredibly durable, can go toe to toe with the worst the Warhammer 40k universe can put out. Star Wars E-11 Blasters are no match for Astartes armor; you'd need Big Fucking Guns to even have a shot; Disruptors, E-Web emplacements, heck, start firing missiles or whatever man portable heavy weapons because a an 8ft tall monster is charging your line at 70+ mph and nothing is gonna stop him. Give him ANY weapon; and it's a stomp. At that point, your better off just trying to Base Delta Zero the planet and pray to the Force he dies. Bonus Round: The Custodian rips every Stormtrooper apart. You think Space Marines are fast? It's theorized the Custodians were created to cull the Space Marines after the Great Crusade, since in the Defense of Terra during the Heresy of Horus, the Custodians noted how easy it was to kill the Heretic Astartes......."

The university of Harvard wants to create a nuclear weapon with a yield of at least one kiloton, all the staff and students want to do this and they also have full access of their budget.

Round 2: They also have to detonate it in New York City.","No. The problem isn't necessariky building the bomb. Any half-decent bomb-maker can make a nuke in their garage.

"argumenta sobre: Boxer vs. a totally untrained and inexperienced average man, armed with a knife How well a boxer would fare in a fight against an inexperienced and untrained, but bloodlusted and armed with a knife average man. I've heard 2 completely different viewpoints about ""boxer vs. knife"" fighting scenario – it was either ""knife guy kills the boxer, there's no knife defense in boxing and even with that, boxer would still receive too many stabs and cuts and will either die immediately or later, from sustained wounds and bleeding"" or ""boxer would only need 1 good punch to KO a knife guy, because average and untrained people aren't conditioned for taking punches from boxers, heck, even pro boxers aren't immune to that. Also, knives aren't that dangerous and few cuts or stabs aren't gonna incapacitate a boxer under the adrenaline rush and psychological determination, nor they would be always lethal too - people did survived multiple gunshots and many stabbing wounds, as it's proven by medical, criminal and emergency statistics, CCTV footages and police bodycams, so, boxer wins unless knife guys gets very lucky and instantly kills a boxer with a single stab or cut and somehow avoids getting knocked out, which is nearly impossible"". So, who's right and who's wrong there? Circumstances: fight happens on a parking lot. No retreat for both. One-on-one confrontation, no help and no interference, both opponents are aware of each other. Win by knockout, incapacitation or death.","There's a video on YouTube where they had different people, MMA fighter, some combat vet type, etc, see if they could win against a knife. They all got stabbed many many times."
"argumenta sobre: A T-800 replaces Frodo as the Ring Bearer. Starting from the Shire, can it get the One Ring into Mount Doom? Round 1: A factory default T-800. Its only directive is to get the ring into the volcano. The Fellowship will try to help it, but they can not reason with it or explain why simply walking into Mordor is a bad idea. If they get in the way, the T-800 will register them as enemies. It does not understand stealth or tactics. Can it make the journey without getting stopped by magic, cave trolls, or simply overwhelming numbers of Orcs and Uruk-Hai? Round 2: Arnold's well-educated T-101 from Terminator 2. It appears human, can converse semi-normally with humanoid races, and does understand stealth and tactics. It will also be far more willing to work with the Fellowship. Round 3: Same as above, but its directive is to protect Frodo at all costs and follow his orders to the letter. Instead of replacing Frodo, it replaces the Fellowship. It can not take the ring from Frodo. Bonus Round: Round 1 but it's a T-1000.","Even assuming it walked directly to Mt Doom in a straight line, I'd say there's a good chance even for R1. Given the kind of weapons it was meant to survive, I don't think the orcs would be able to so much to stop it short of throwing it into a volcano, which is exactly what it wants. Most of the biggest threats in Sauron's army akaik weren't present until later and a terminator would make the journey many times faster than anyone else could. R2 is pretty much guaranteed victory. Frodo succeeded there and he's not a super strong combat robot. R3 is interesting, I think victory would depend on what allies Frodo encountered. I'm fairly confident a terminator would make a better bodyguard than Sam, and the rest of the fellowship wasn't even around for most of Frodo's journey, but if Frodo has to survive he'd probably have to take the same routes to avoid the orcs, most of which he learned from Smeagol. There's also the fact that Frodo could fall to the ring as he did, in which case the robot would do nothing to finish the job and probably prevent anyone or anything else from doing so either."

"argumenta sobre: A man whose stats double every minute vs a man who clones himself every minute Two identical men, lets say 25 years old in prime physical shape decide to fight. Unknown to either man, both have a secret ability. &x200B; Man 1 stat's double every minute he fights. After 1 minute passes, he's twice as strong, twice as fast ect. Man 2 on the other hand, clones himself every minute. After another minute passes both he and the clone, clone themselves once again. By 2 minutes 4 of them exist. &x200B; Who wins?",">Unknown to either man, both have a secret ability. I think that's really significant here. Prime physical shape 25 year olds? The fight really might end before a minute is up. If it doesn't, the 2-on-1 round should be decisively in favor of the clones. Numbers count for so, so much in a fight, and if they are already tangled up the sudden appearance of the clone is likely to be too much to recover from. If double stats man can survive until he is four times as tough and fast as the clones, it will start to tip back the other way as they are no longer able to readily hurt him and he gets to a point where he just shreds through them. Google says an average punch lands with something like 320 lbs of force. More google-fu shows that peak force recorded for olympic boxers is more like 1200 lbs which is roughly consistent with what they found on that fight science discover show where they analyzed kicks and punches. More to the point, olympic boxers roll with that kind of punishment, so this guy is going to be soaking forces four times that amount. The clones are still slinging out 320lb punches, but this monster can fade, parry, or just face-tank four to sixteen times that. So for the first minute there is a chance either fighter just wins outright due to dumb luck. Fighting is dangerous sometimes people get KTFO'd. Call it... 1/10 for either of them. Of the remaining 8/10, I predict clone guy takes the vast majority when he suddnely has a clone who isn't rolling around on the ground. Sure, the other guy is now stronger and tougher, but being twice as tough is still not tough enough to survive getting curb stomped repeatedly. I'm giving 6 of the 8 remaining rounds to Clone Guy, and that might be too conservative. Of the remaining three rounds where Double Stat Man survives to be four times as everything, I think he absolutely stomps. It's just a violent, slightly embarrassing massacre. tl;dr, Clone Guy 7/10, with Double Man taking it handily in any iteration where he survives the first two minutes."
"argumenta sobre: Who is the strongest Marvel superhero that Homelander The Boys can defeat? You read the title. Homelander gets feats from the show, the comics, the Diabolical series and Gen V. He is in character. Neither he or the hero have prior knowledge of each other. Round 1: MCU Round 2: 616 Comics","Round 1: The MCU's strongest hero he could defeat is Spiderman; Spiderman is actually at top end of alive MCU heroes, because he casually stopped a two-handed Cull Obsidian mace swing and calmly chatted with Tony while holding Cull Obsidian's full strength at bay. Cull Obsidian was intended to fight the Hulk in the original screenplay, and instead was ""downgraded""? to fighting the Hulk Buster - you know, the thing that beat the crap out of the Hulk, and he was beating the Hulk Buster. That means Spiderman is in the top 5, alongside Captain Marvel, Hulk, Shang Chi now THAT'S a departure from the comics, Jesus Christ., and Thor. America Chavez doesn't count YET. Of them, only Spiderman doesn't have any kind of resistance to Homelander's attacks Shang Chi's got enchanted armor. Add in the fact that Spiderman is only SOMETIMES using his spider sense effectively, and you have a recipe for Homelander being able to hit and therefore kill him. I give that to Homelander 4/10 times. We know that Peter CAN use his spider sense to become an untouchable god in the MCU, and we also know he can hit hard enough to stagger cull/thanos, so that's gonna be hard enough to hurt Homelander. So the question is whether he goes full bore, or he fucks up and Homelander gibs him. Round 2: Homelander will never touch 616 Spiderman, who is only a little stronger than MCU Spidey, but a LOT faster, more agile, untouchable, etc. Spiderman would tear him apart with probably some civilian casualties from the heat vision and Peter underestimating how hard it is to drop him. So... probably... I'm gonna go with Moon Knight. Don't fucking laugh. Moon Knight in the comics is a terrifying beast, but he's not consistently strong enough to fight Homelander most of the time. He is definitely the strongest street tier that isn't Spiderman; Luke Cage and Iron Fist can suck it."

"argumenta sobre: Spider-Man Marvel vs Toji Jujutsu Kaisen Morals off for both. Both start 20 meters apart. Both have all of their gear. Fight is won through the last man standing by either the death, incapacitation or BFR of all other opponents.","Pretty sure Spider-Man takes this pretty solidly like 7/10 times if he's serious from the get go, Spider Sense can fail in more complex situations, but in a 1v1 there's not really much that should hamper it. Spidey regularly dodges bullets, and fights people supremely faster than him all the time as well and is extremely adept at disarming much more impressive people than Toji and they should be relative to each other even disregarding Spider Sense, so I don't think it really matters that Toji has the SSK that theoretically should one shot if it lands. Webbing is a massively versatile weapon all things considered, and none of Toji's kit is really tricky enough to bypass what Spidey has since its mostly geared for fighting spirit users. I give Toji the 3/10 if he can get a lucky shot off with the chain of a thousand miles as that could potentially create situations where pre-cog doesn't matter. But that's just such a convoluted wincon compared to Spider-Man just punching Toji's head off while he's hampered by webs."
"argumenta sobre: Who is the strongest Devil Chainsaw Man that Frieren Frieren can kill? Morals off for both. Both start 20 meters apart. Both have all of their gear. Fight is won through the last man standing by either the death, incapacitation or BFR of all other opponents.","Kinda hard to tell honestly. She can kill every Devil that Denji has also killed without much issue at least. Except maybe Eternity, as I don't know if Frieren can pull the same stunt as Denji and continuously torture it for 3 days straight without rest, and without getting injured herself as she can't heal. Pt. 2 Eternity also doesn't show up at all, so Frieren just dies of starvation against it as she has no way of escaping. Quanxi also beats her with sheer speed. But there's a big jump in power between a lot of the average Devils Denji defeats and the top dogs. Whether because of sheer speed, and/or having insane regeneration, as well as hax, they're too much for her. Gun Devil? Too much speed, range and firepower. Makima? Too many lives, and her range and firepower is similar to the former, with some hax to boot. Pochita? Too fast, too tough, and too strong. The Primals? Downright immortal with a range of hax that Frieren has no defense against. Even glass cannons like Full-Devil Power and Yoru w/ her Gun and Tank upgrade can get her before she gets them. More so the latter thanks to her nailing Pochita repeatedly. Against Power it's more up in the air whether Frieren can shoot her before she gets impaled from the inside out by her own blood."

During his final confrontation with Near, Light Yagami is arrested without complications.

Tony becomes very distinctly aware of this as everyone begins to get ready to fight. R2: As the alien ship comes down onto New York in Infinity War, a bridge collapses and kills thousands. Among the casualties is a bus full of students, including Peter Parker. Stark is not aware of his death. R3: Vulture discovers Spider-Man's secret identity at the beginning of Homecoming. Deciding that he's a danger to his business, he destroys his home and crushes him under the rubble. Without the strength to pull himself up out of it and an unlucky impalement through the chest, he dies under the rubble. Stark becomes aware of his death a few hours later. R4: Peter Parker is never born in this timeline. The concept of Spider-Man never exists.","R1: Assuming that someone else fills in for Peter in the gauntlet relay and it still ends up with Carol, then Thanos, it's possible that Tony is too distracted by his absence to do what he needs to and get the stones to make the snap. In this scenario, Thanos snaps and everyone in the universe is erased from existence to create a new world. R2: While Peter helps defend Tony early on in Infinity War, I'd work off the assumption that Tony would be alright. While Spidey was definitely helpful throughout the events of this movie, I think Iron Man and Doc Strange would still be able to work with the guardians to have similar results. However, eventually Tony would find out that Peter died, and would still probably blame it on himself, causing him to still feel guilt. Whether or not this guilt would still motivate him to try and discover time travel and undo the snap, however, is uncertain because all of that wouldn't save Peter since he died outside the snap. I'd wager Tony might still try but he'd probably get distracted by the side goal of saving Peter either through the snap or time travel which could be problematic. R3: Stark feels guilty, and reaches out to Cap sooner because he's upset about his failings. They re-start their friendship and this potentially helps them against Thanos since the team would be more united. However, since Civil War still took place, the UN and Accords are still in place, which would still limit the efforts of the whole gang. Ant Man and Hawkeye probably still take house arrest deals, and Cap, Widow, Falcon, and Wanda probably still need to live on the run just with Tony's and Rhodey's help. R4: Iron Man doesn't recruit Peter for his team in Civil War. Cap and Bucky still reach the jet and find the now dead winter soldiers. Cap and Tony still have their falling out, Vulture still keeps selling stolen Stark tech though without Spidey either Stark himself intervenes or the FBI finally does something. Infinity War happens mostly the same as R2 but now Tony has no motivation for researching time travel since he never knew or lost Peter. The remaining Avengers still try to figure out time travel, but with only Hulk/Banner and Lang, they never get past the planning stages. The snap is never undone, and the status quo of life five years afterward remains. Tony raises his daughter Morgan with Pepper, Cap continues leading the support group, Clint continues his murderous rampage, Nat still receives emails from Rocket and Carol, etc."
"argumenta sobre: Who would win: Martin Brody Jaws vs. Bruce Jaws vs. Spinosaurus Jurassic Park franchise Let's imagine that the Spinosaurus from Jurassic Park 3 is suddenly teleported to Amity Island during the events of Jaws 1975. Therefore, Amity police chief Martin Brody finds himself dealing with two monsters: one is a prehistoric reptile and the other is an unusually large and aggressive Great White Shark. In a free-for-all involving a human, a dinosaur, and a highly aggressive Great White, which combatant would last the longest? Breakdown of the combatants: 1. Martin Brody has an M1 Garand rifle, and a service revolver. 2. The Spino and Bruce both have teeth but Spino also has claws. Win conditions: One side has to kill the other two in order to win. Edit: Given the fact that the Spinosaurus is pretty OP, the only real question is can Martin Brody beat the Spino?","Considering the guns he shot were chambered in .30-06, and .38 special, he's more likely to piss it off than to kill it. Give him an elephant gun like 700 nitro express, or an anti material rifle like a Barrett m82, those other guns especially the pistol don't stand a chance."
"argumenta sobre: Can Popeye survive an onslaught of ""dark Supermen"" A being with access to infinite realities wants Popeye dead. They try to find dark parallels to Superman considering he's powerful but actual Superman would be too difficult to convince. Homelander, Brightburn, Plutonian and Omni-Man are all located and the being focuses in on them. The being is capable of grabbing as many infinite variants of these characters to attack Popeye. Popeye has no prep time but does have access to one can of spinach per day. Win conditions: -Dark Superman army has to kill Popeye permanently. -Popeye has to survive an entire week","Popeye, like Superman, is as strong as he needs to be when fed. Just like Superman can perform any act of strength when bathed in yellow sun, Popeye can perform any act of strength while hyped on spinach. Imagine him swinging his big forearm in a circle, and with each rotation it deflects an eye beam into another dark Superman and simultaneously knocks another Superman unconscious. They fly into him one after another, so fast that 30 frames a second can't catch every rotation, and yet he is cleaning all their clocks."
"argumenta sobre: The Eastern Front but Taylor Swift replaces Joseph Stalin and Kanye West replaces Adolf Hitler, who wins? It is September 13th, 15 years ago Kanye West had ruined Taylor Swift's once in a lifetime moment at the VMAs. Now 15 years have passed and Round 2 will commence. We go back in time to September 13, 1939. World War 2 has just started but there is a twist. Adolf Hitler is replaced with Kanye West and Joseph Stalin is replaced with Taylor Swift. This is done Quantum Leap style where people look at 'Stalin' or 'Hitler' and they visually look normal, but mentally and personality wise they're obviously different people. They still retain their respective historical figures' knowledge of politics and warfare but they have the personalities of either Taylor Swift/Kanye West, which is the main factor as to how this changes the Eastern Front. For example, 'Hitler' AKA Kanye still has his addiction to nitrous oxide and Taylor Swift has her addiction with flying on private planes. Round 1: Both in character, 'present day' versions of both so yes, Kanye has his current... 'Beliefs' as the two start off in 1939 with their respective nations the Soviet Union and Third Reich. Round 2: FDR is replaced with Pete Davidson and Mussolini is replaced with Drake. How does this affect things?","Taylor's got this. I don't know that much about her, but she's at least a somewhat rational person who should be willing to listen to her generals. She's also just been dealt the better hand here - her country has a larger population and industrial base, and so much of Germany's early success depended on them catching the USSR off guard, which won't happen now because she presumably has a basic knowledge of history. Kanye, meanwhile, is starting off from a much weaker position and he's, you know, insane. I don't think he could prosecute the war competently and would likely be deposed or assassinated when things go catastrophically wrong. Also, congrats on the truly batshit post."
"argumenta sobre: Middle Earth LOTR VS the Zombie Apocalypse Walking Dead. Who survives? The entirety of Middle Earth is infected by the virus from the Walking Dead. Rules: - The infection affects Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Orcs, and Trolls. Upon dying, all of these will turn into a Walker zombie bent on devouring the flesh of any living being. - Being bitten by a zombie will result in the victim turning into a zombie anywhere between a few minutes to 8 hours. - There is no cure and none can be created. Athelas, Elven magic and dark sorcery might slow it down, but undeath is inevitable. - Animals and Ents are immune to the infection. Both will still be targeted by Zombies. - Maiar Sauron, Gandalf, Saruman, etc, the Nazgûl, and other supernatural beings are immune to infection but can still die from zombie attacks if in physical form. - Zombies cannot be controlled by any supernatural means, so Sauron can't bend them to his will. - There will be no divine intervention from the Valar or Ilúvatar. Middle Earth is on its own. Middle Earth will also have to face starvation, infighting, and even wars for resources as Kingdom by Kingdom they dwindle. Supernatural means can still be used to keep lands safe or hidden, but resources may dwindle eventually. No one is aware of the infection until it begins spreading. Which Kingdoms can survive for a minimum of 10 years? Which Kingdoms can survive indefinitely? Bonus: Which characters can survive the apocalypse indefinitely? Book or Movie versions. Round 1: Scenario begins immediately after Frodo receives the One Ring. Round 2: Scenario begins immediately before the Council of Elrond begins. Round 3: Scenario begins immediately after Saruman's Uruk-Hai army leaves Isengard en route to Helm's-Deep. Round 4: Scenario begins a day before Sauron's armies begin their attack on Gondor.","""The entirely of Middle Earth is infected"" doesn't make any sense. Please specify where the virus outbreaks and how many are initially affected. Because it's very simple to make a conclusion bite->zombie even without knowledge about infections, any small outbreak is getting squashed fast. Every country besides hobbits basically lives in warrior cuilture. Unless you turn the whole of Arnor or Gondor into a zombie land from the start, Middle Earth clears low diff. Just like real world clears btw, zombie apocalypse is a pure fantasy. If you turn the entirety of Mordor into zombie land it actually decreases the difficulty btw. Even you go max hardcore, dwarves and elves could just ignore it indefinitely. One race sees the world flat and could just kill any stragglers coming their way from a distance, other lives in realisticaly invulnerable fortresses."

Patrick Star from Spongebob Squarepants has his calculus final exam at Bikini Bottom University in 4 months and must get an A to pass the class and Batman is teachinglusted, meaning he will devote himself entirely for the next 4 months to teaching Patrick. The rules are: 1. Batman cannot help Patrick cheat on the actual exam, he gets 4 months to tutor Patrick but once Patrick walks into the exam room when time's up he's by himself. 2. Batman cannot create a device that magically raises Patrick's intelligence. Can the Caped Crusader and the God of prep time help the dumb starfish who found an id in his wallet but wouldn't conclude the wallet was his? Bonus Question: If this is too much for Batman, he gets a do over and gets to choose between Braniac and Yoda to help him. Who does he choose and can the new team pull it off? Edit: Since a lot of the answers are brain coral, while a genius idea, let's say there is a seasonal lack of brain coral in Bikini Bottom. However, the professor sympathizes with Patrick's plight and will award generous partial credit to any answer that is somewhat close and will give Patrick the benefit of the doubt on his answers.",I'm pretty sure Patrick is straight up too stupid.

"argumenta sobre: Elephant v.s. Human with weapons made from Home Depot / Lowes. A debate with my wife after a trip to the hardware store. Specifics: - Bloodlusted African bull elephant - Fight takes place in an arena the size of the Colosseum - Human has access to all tools/ supplies in a hardware store for 24 hours - No access to the arena before the fight, must be able to transport everything he/she prepared through the arena entrance immediately prior My thought was that your best bet would be making a giant metal spear that you can stick the butt of in the ground to use the strength of the elephant against it when it charges you, every other idea seemed like a gimmick. My wife was arguing for using/ making a hazmat suit and manufacturing chemical weapons I don't think they would work fast enough or have enough stopping power, and am not sure what the strongest ones you could make are from standard supplies. What is the strategy with highest probability of success?",I have access to big hardware store? Shit I am going to start with Ammonium nitrate pipe bombs with ball bearings for shrapnel. Relatively speaking this should take down a full grown african elephant but lets step it up a notch and find the big propane tanks remove the safety valves and tape several road flares to the top. Those things produce big ass fireballs when they go but they are hard to time right cause they take 10-15 seconds before they go boom once you open the valve. Lastly I am going to need a respirator liquid ammonia and bleach and a pressure washer. put the amonia in the mix tank usually used for soaps and have the pressure washer draw instead of water from a big tub of bleach like a kiddy pool or whatever. The pressure washer should spray a good distance and aerosolize the mixture into a nasty caustic substance. Now the thing is riddled with holes and bleeding out from being pipe bombed repeatedly. Nasty 3rd degree burns over the entirety of its body. And now I am spraying it with caustic chemicals that become lethal vapors. I didnt have to get anywhere near the thing.

The other 43 POTUS's, past and present, are pulled through time to serve as his quarry. Each president including Roosevelt is at their peak during their tenure. The following scenarios then unfold: Round 1 Each of the 43 is released individually upon the island, and must survive for 3 days while they are hunted by Roosevelt. They are given a 3-hour head start. 1a Roosevelt is given a team of 3 hunting dogs. 1b No dogs Who survives? Round 2 The hunted Presidents are released in small groups, which are as follows: 1. Washington, Adams, and Jefferson 2. Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy Adams 3. Jackson, Van Buren, and Harrison 4. Tyler, Polk, and Taylor 5. Filmore, Pierce, and Buchanan 6. Lincoln, Johnson, and Grant 7. Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur 8. Cleveland, Harrison, and McKinley 9. Taft, Wilson, and Harding 10. Coolidge, Hoover, and FDR 11. Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy 12. Johnson, Nixon, and Ford 13. Ford, Carter, and Reagan 14. Bush 41, Clinton, and Bush 43 15. Obama, Trump, and...Washington... At least one team member must survive for the three days for the hunted to win. They are given a 3-hour head start. Teddy has dogs. Who survives? 3 All of the hunted Presidents are released at the same time. No head start. Teddy has dogs. Who survives? Equipment and such: Roosevelt is equipped with the best hunting gea and such that would have been available in his time. Each hunted President carries one period-appropriate knife of their choosing, but is otherwise unequipped. EDIT: For the sake of entertainment, I present: Round 3b Same as round 3, but Teddy is bloodlusted. EDIT 2: I PUT FORD TWICE. R2 teams remain unchanged, but my soul is crushed.","Of 45 presidents, 29 have served in the military including Roosevelt, obviously. This gives certain teams an obvious edge, depending on how much active duty they saw and where. I think most presidents before Roosevelt will have a harder time. They won't be as familiar with the rifle of Teddy's era so he could use that to his advantage, but I don't think it would be a huge advantage. Where the early presidents have an advantage is their familiarity with ""roughing it"" or living off the land. Later presidents who depend on modern amenities will likely have a harder time. My short list for presidents who do well and I'm no expert so feel free to dispute me is Grant, Jackson, Taylor, McKinley, maybe Washington. Short list of presidents who do the worst: Trump, Taft, Obama, Clinton. There are a lot of presidents I know nothing about though, so we'll see"

"argumenta sobre: Is it posible for someone to be a functioning member of society if you are stuck in one frames per second? To those of you who do not play computer games I will break down for you what that means. Your average human operates at 60 frames a second if your there your golden things look like a movie. 30 frames a second is passable but still looks a bit off and it doesn't look as good as 60. 15 is where things get crusty you can actully see the game buffering as you play and updating your frame rate but you can still manage. This is the least amount of frames I will play with before calling it a night. 7 is the least ammount of frames you can have and still be playable at all. It updates frames very slowly and while you can still play in theory it isn't fun at all. At 1 frame per second things get very surreal, dialogue comes out like. A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A and then it jumped forward to the next frame which is just as incoherent as the last. Every second loops the animation and sound extremely fast. You literally can't do anything when this happens, in game I call it a night and turn my computer off but it almost doesn't happen. So someone in 1fps would be teleporting forward five or so feet ever second and repeating the same syllable until a second has passed. Can someone actually function in society with such garbage fps?

There will be to different Anakins running around: the Jedi Knight and the Sith Lord 2. Not wanting to ruin his past self's life or ruin his already fragile metal state, he has decided to keep his identity from everyone including his younger self. However if someone is able to figure it out he will be truthful 3. Vader still wants his younger self to marry Padmé, his will be one of his major goals.

I kinda expected this to die in new! Thanks Everyone!","Taking down Palpatine would probably be the most surefire way to achieve his goal, with Palps gone there no chance of Anakin turning. There are a few ways he could go about this. - Just go kill him himself: Its unlikely he could solo Palps but he could recruit allies to help him. There are quite a few people he could convince to help him, either through telling them the truth, lying to them or offering them some other incentive. If he can convince Dooku he will be betrayed he may be able to get Dooku and Grievous to help, Maul and Savage were enemies of Palpatine so he could team up with them, otherwise some of the more pragmatic Jedi might be convinced to help. - Attempt to assassinate him with a bomb or something. There are probably plenty of anti republic groups that would help with a plot to assassinate the supreme chancellor, he could also hire bounty hunters. Palpatine might be able to sense the assassination plot with the force but he was still ultimately blown up with the death star so he clearly isn't infallible in this regard. Blowing up a ship that Palpatine was on would probably be sufficient to kill him. - Finally he could just try and expose Palpatine as a Sith lord and let the Jedi take him down. With his knowledge of the future he has a good shot at being able to expose Palps and ruin his plan. Which round he appears in would make quite a big difference as the earlier he appears the more time he will have to recruit allies and come up with a plan. The first two should be easy as he has years, round 3 would be a bit tricky as he doesn't have very long. Aside from killing plaps there are also a few other things he could try that might prevent Anakins fall to the Dark side. - Save Shimi from the Tusken Raiders, not losing his mother might stop Anakin from turning. - Delay Anakins arrival to palpatines office, if he arrives after Windu has already killed Palps he can't turn. - Go kill Maul or Grievous so that Obi-Wan/Ahsoka wont be busy at the end of ROTS, if they were on coruscant with Anakin they might stop Anakin from turning. - Just go fuck up the Separatists and kill all their leaders, if he can hurt the Separatists bad enough that the war ends much earlier, that would ruin Palpatines plan and might Prevent Anakin from turning. - Save Qui-Gon so that he can train Anakin instead, Anakin might be better off with Qui-Gon training him as Qui-Gon was a lot more laid back than other Jedi. - Kill Mace Windu, Windu was a dick to Anakin, without him around Anakin might not turn. - Kill Baris Offee, this way the temple bombings never happen and Ahsoka is never framed and doesn't leave the Jedi order."

"argumenta sobre: Can Earth Survive: Every Cell Phone is now a B1 Battle Droid. Every cell phone/smart phone has now poofed into a B1 Battle Droid they poof off to the side so that if there is a cell phone in someone's pocket, they dont explode from Droid spawn in. The Droids are blood lusted/lack self-preservation instincts but CANNOT use ranged weapons. They can use melee weapons like machetes, shovels, spears, knives, etc., and can pilot cars/trains/planes/boats, but with subpar finesse.","The shows have main characters defeating them in hand-to-hand combat but they also have a clone trooper breaking their hand after punching one while running at it. The droid is almost entirely unphased. Clones weigh around 180lb so idk some math nerd could probably give some numbers but the fact is a 140 lb droid is able to easily withstand a punch to the head by a 180 lb male soldier. Since they're bloodlusted I think the droids mostly succeed in killing any isolated person they spawn next to. A lot of heads of state die. That said, is it common for soldiers to carry cell phones? I feel like it's not so I imagine active duty military are relatively unscathed. Groups of law enforcement are probably able to hold them off too. The droids are not familiar with our tech so they won't knock out communications stuff and they might not even be able to figure out our guns when it comes to reloading and maintenance. So I think the militaries around the world quickly respond and probably clean up almost all of them within a week but a lot of humans will be dead. There are 7 billion of them but assuming they don't have a hive mind you just have a shit ton of bloodlusted automatons that aren't trying to be sneaky or work together that potentially have to be within an arm's reach to hurt you. Even if they can work together, they have none of their usual backup ie no tanks, air support, other kinds of units and they have no way to blend in with local populations. We've also never seen them really run so I'm not convinced they can. Jogging is the fastest we've seen them move, so an average human can probably outrun them. And finally, maintenance. ""It's not that kind of movie, kid"" but these things probably require a lot of maintenance that they're used to routinely getting. Without that how long can they even go for?"

"argumenta sobre: What is the least amount of powers/weapons/artifacts you'd need from the Marvel or DC universe to attain a godly amount of power? Now, of course you could probably say 1 item, because there is probably an obscure artifact called ""The Hand of God"" that gives its wielder godly abilities, so I want to make this more challenging. Say we have this guy named Joe. He can do everything a normal man can. Joe can get into most public buildings, take a plane to most countries, and if he asks really nicely, he can hitch a ride with Green Lantern or Star Lord and travel to some inhabited planets. &x200B; Basically whatever a normal DC or Marvel civilian/background character can do, he can. It is what he \knows\ that sets him apart. He knows exactly where every artifact of power is held, he knows exactly how to obtain every force or power, and he knows exactly where every mighty weapon or armor piece is held. With this knowledge, Joe wants to become one of the most powerful people in his universe, roughly on par with Franklin Richards, or Dr. Manhattan. The only thing stopping him is, well, everything. He can't waltz up to Thor and take his hammer, because even if he was worthy, Thor wouldn't let him have it and he isn't strong enough to take it. He can't just request a green lantern ring because he only has a normal amount of willpower. &x200B; So, to obtain godly power, Joe needs to be strategic. He needs to go for the easiest to access yet most accessible powe/weapon, and then use the powers or abilities of that thing in order to get another one, and another, until he is either able to reach a certain synergy between weapons or abilities that gives him godly powers, or until he is able to reach a power level where he is able to simply take that power from someone else, such as taking the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos. &x200B; The question is, how does Joe strategize? Which thing does he go for first? choose between the two universes, whichever is your favorite, and what is the most efficient way to get from that first step to the last? And just for fun, after having obtained these powers, either for evil or good, what would his super powered name be?","In a recent AskReddit or something about getting to enter a fictional world and gathering abilities before bouncing, I said DC Comics. All you would have to do is go to whomever is the current Flash, tell them you're a speedster from another world using your intimate knowledge of how the Speed Force works, how DC functions, etc. and more than likely, they'll believe you and help you regain powers that an evil supervillain stole from you. Once you have the Speed Force, it may take a little time to figure out how to use all the abilities, but for the most part just knowing the powers exist gives you a significant boost in likely success. From there, you can pretty much gather whatever tools/abilities you want with relative ease. First, go for Booster Gold so you can get his time travel and basic protection tech. If you screw something up, you'll need to easily go back without time stream repercussions."

Bonus: What if he transformed into a 500-foot termite instead?","Ants are relatively much stronger than humans, being able to lift 5 times their own weight. I'm too lazy rn, but I would have to do calcs for the mass of the ant so I could determine how much exactly ant-man could lift, but I think this could change infinity war significantly.

"argumenta sobre: The movies from the fake trailers from Tropic Thunder get released in real life. Which does the best? The movies are with their respective real life actors - Satan's Alley: unironic drama about medieval homosexuals, starring RDJ and Tobey - Scorcher: average action movie starring Ben Stiller - Scorchers 2-6: average action movie sequels starring Ben Stiller - The Fatties: A ""comedy"" starring Jack Black and more Jack Blacks - Simple Jack: unironic drama about the life of an autistic boy starring Ben Stiller R1: Which makes the most and least money in the box office R2: Which gets the highest and lowest rating from critics R3: Can any of them win an oscar","I feel like Scorcher probably does best. Ben Stiller doing an action movie would get attention for the sheer novelty of it, and that kind of pivot worked out alright for Liam Neeson. Action movies can also survive being mediocre. RDJ is a bigger draw than Stiller, but Satan's Alley does not have a broadly commercial premise. The Daniel Craig movie Queer released last year - which feels like maybe a reasonable comparison - and it made <$7M worldwide. Add on that Satan's Alley doesn't actually seem like it's supposed to be GOOD, and it's hard to see it doing crazy numbers. You could argue that RDJ would elevate its potential, but he didn't get anyone I know to watch the Sympathizer. Black is arguably a bigger draw than Stiller too - The Minecraft Movie is doing remarkably well for some reason - but the Fatties just looks like a radioactively awful movie. And there's nothing worse than an unfunny comedy. I think this bombs. Simple Jack is last, though. Maybe it gets an ironic cult following after the fact like in the movie, but nobody would pay to see that in theaters."

Now imagine someone who only thinks of buttons as something that go on clothes. George Washington was an intelligent and educated man but he's also as close in time to knights in plate armor as he is to us. He died shortly after the cotton gin was invented and he would be dead forty years before a photograph was taken. Furthermore Halo isn't some baby's first game like Pac-man. It's fast, complex, requires you to operate two joysticks simultaneously while pushing shoulder buttons and face buttons on the fly. Nevermind the system shock of sexy AIs, space aliens and guns that fire more than twice a minute. You'd have to have a team slowly train him like a mountain climber or even an astronaut.

"argumenta sobre: Could the Western Allies have defeated Nazi Germany without the USSR? Similar to my post about the USSR fighting Nazi Germany without Western aid, could the United States, Great Britain, and France have defeated Nazi Germany if the Germans hadn't broken their nonaggression pact with the Soviets and we assume the reverse doesn't happen either?","It might have dragged out longer, but the overwhelming advantage in Allied airpower on the Western Front would have ultimated doomed the Third Reich: Germany couldn't even knock Britain out of the War because of their inability to neutralize the RAF and get across the Channel during the BOB, which ended nearly a full year before Operation Barbarossa providing the Western Allies a secure base from which to carry out the fighting. The single biggest threat to Allied efforts out of Britain were the U-boats attacking the convoys. Russia not entering the War would have had little effect on the U-boat campaign, and once the Allies perfected anti-submarine use of aircraft, the U-boat scourge largely ended. Less about aircraft, but American industry produced hundreds of thousands of trucks, vehicles, and aircraft altogether that were sent to Russia under Lend-Lease. All these resources would now be funneling to the Western Allies, instead. This would have bolstered Allied forces in North Africa. Mechanization was one of the biggest advantages the Allies had: Germany never truly mechanized its logistics support, and still made considerably use of horses for moving equipment. The Strategic Bombing Campaign ground the Luftwaffe into dust, and while the Eastern Front was where the infantry went to die, many German pilots saw being sent to the Western Front, especially the Defense of the Reich, as a death sentence. This was especially the case once long-range escorts like the P-51 and later models of P-47 beginning with the D-25 became available. More important was the change in tactics when Doolittle took command: Close escort proved to not be particularly effective. Instead, Doolittle decided to put the fighters on seek-and-destroy. Their one and only mission was to destroy the Luftwaffe wherever it could be found. Rather than remain with the bombers, Allied fighters would range out ahead to intercept the Luftwaffe before making contact with the formations. Although the bomber crews were unnerved and derogatorily called the fighter pilots ""Glory Boys,"" thinking they were out to look for kills rather than protect them, the strategy soon proved its efficacy. Bomber loss rates plummeted, while losses for the Luftwaffe became untenable. In addition to sweeping the skies ahead of the bomber formations, Allied fighters were were merciless in hitting the Luftwaffe on the ground, as well. Tactical strikes were targeted at the German airfields, and escort fighters on their return legs were released to attack targets of opportunity, often chasing German fighters all the way back to their airfields and shooting them down there. The Wehrmacht simply COULD NOT MOVE by daylight once the Allies achieved air superiority over Europe. The entire reason the German offensive in the Ardennes managed to get as far as it did was because weather grounded the Allied air forces and prevented them from supporting the infantry. Once the weather broke, airstrikes against the German infantry was merciless. Allied airpower annihilated what logistics the Germans had. Trains were destroyed, supply depots were strafed, rocketed, and bombed, roads were attacked. The extra men and equipment that would have been freed up had the Russians not entered the War might have made things harder, but the way the actual War in Western Europe played out would not have changed much."
"argumenta sobre: Balrog vs the city of New York Inspired by this post If New York city unearthed a balrog while digging a subway tunnel, could New York handle it without any outside help. No federal aid, no federal military. The city can use anything at its disposal. If the mayor has to call for help from outside the city then it's considered a win for the balrog","The Balrog is… difficult. It's not just some giant fire monster, it's basically a god with a lowercase gI'd say demigod but that term has lost its original meaning. The problem is it is immune to mortal weapons, and highly resistant to magic. Like Casper after he hit the gym. It's unlikely that even the entire world's military could kill it, so our only hope is to outbreed the amount of people it kills."

"argumenta sobre: Napoleonic war but with AKMs In 1803, time portals appear between the 1960s USSR and the world back then. One portal in each capital of all countries involved in the Napoleonic war. They sell AKMs to whichever government wants to buy one, at 2 grams of fine gold per piece. Weapon comes as is with 1 magazine attached, no ammo. All miscellaneous items have to be purchased separately. They will also provide maintenance, ammo, training etc anything needed to support the use of the AKMs, but these have to be negotiated in seperate contracts and the price will vary. Any maintenance/repairs etc will involve the weapons being sent back through the portal to the USSR for work to be done on them. Ammo and accesories, once handed over, will have to be delivered by each army's supply chain. The USSR will deliver purchased items to the customer's side of the portal for collection. Training will only cover how to handle the weapons and any miscellaneous stuff like how to transport ammo properly etc so it's up to the armies themselves to figure out how to integrate the AKM with their tactics. Trainers will be available in all languages so no language barrier there. Assume the USSR stays neutral so it doesn't overly support russia, and has the same terms of sale for all nations. Assume also that the USSR will be able to produce infinite AKMs, but production and transport times still apply. How does the war play out? Ignore any effects on the 1960s USSR. Edit: rifle grenades and grenade launchers aren't available for purchase","Wait, this is just Guns of the South with extra steps! Considering that book had the Confederacy with AK-47s absolutely smoking the Union…I'd say the same would happen with Napoleon."
"argumenta sobre: Master Chief and the Doom Slayer must destroy the Death Star. Can they do it? Master Chief and the Doom Slayer are hired by the Rebels to destroy the Death Star. They must reach the control room and detonate a bomb and flee before it detonates in 30 minutes. Master Chief is equipped with his armor from Halo 4. As for weapons, he is armed with the Assault Rifle, Shotgun, and Magnum. He is maxed out on ammo for all 3 weapons. The Doom Slayer wears his armor from Doom Eternal. He is equipped with all of his signature weapons Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Plasma Rifle, etc.. He also has his shoulder mounted grenade launcher and Doom Blade. He is maxed out on ammo for all weapons. Round 1: Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader are NOT on the Death Star. The Storm Troopers and other Imperial workers onboard the Death Star are not given a heads up. Round 2: Same rules with Round 1, Except that the workers and Storm Troopers are given a 30 minute notice to prepare for Master Chief and Doom Slayers arrival. Round 3: Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader ARE on board the Death Star. The Storm Troopers and the Imperial Workers are not given a heads up beforehand. Bonus Round: The Death Star is on maximum combat readiness, both inside and out.","So I'm gonna start by pointing out a few key things that I don't think other commenters are taking into consideration that I think will turn the tide of some of these battles. Also be prepared this is probably the longest comment I've ever made so TL:DR at the bottom if you need it. First, both MC and Doom Slayer have full ammo sure, but they both are going to run out quickly against a full starship full of mooks. Even if it only takes one shot per enemy, they will probably run out before they even make it to the control room. Chief has been known to pick up weapons along the way to ensure he always has a usable weapon, so he is probably fine, but the Doom Slayer would probably only do that as a last resort, not that it would matter much since he is such a physical powerhouse. Second, they have to go to the control room with the bomb, not the throne room that Vader and Palpatine are normally in. Meaning the only round Vader and Palpatine really matter is in the bonus round since they know the MC and Doom Slayer are coming. Third, some commenters have pointed out that an energy sword could probably match a lightsaber, but Chief doesn't have an energy sword in this prompt, the Doom Slayer has his Doom blade, but I have no idea if that would work against a lightsaber in the same way, so I'm just gonna chalk it up to them not trying to get in an up close confrontation. Fourth, Chief is an extremely good infiltrator, it's literally what he has been trained to be since he was inducted to the spartan program. Slayer on the other hand is great at causing and surviving absolute chaos. Their best course of action in most scenarios would be Doom Slayer doing what he does and Chief sneaking through the death star to the control room and planting the bomb before anyone knows he is there. Lastly, I'm going to assume we are talking about the movie versions of Vader and Palpatine since it wasn't specified and those are the most well known versions of the characters. Plus if we went by their Legends characters I think it would be a no question stomp in favor of the Star Wars universe in every round that the force users are involved. So to finally get to the point of the post- R1: I think both MC and Doom Slayer could solo this round honestly, let alone working together. It would be harder for Doom Slayer considering other than hangars the death star is mostly tight corridors so he wouldn't have much room to move like he normally does. Also Doom Slayer is much less likely to pick up any weapons unless he completely runs out of options, and lastly like others have pointed out he is going to run out of Argent energy sooner or later. But in the end MC and Doom Slayer are on a team so it will be a cinch. They take it 10/10 R2: So really the only factor here is whether they start on the death star or if the have to use a ship to get on it first. If they start onboard already then it will go pretty much exactly the same as R1, but if they have to use a ship, well it depends. Chief can fly pretty much any landing craft from the halo universe but unless he is allowed to use a stealth craft I don't think he can make it past their defenses. A Pelican can't move nearly as fast as a standard Tie fighter and doesn't have the guns to get inside either so Chief would have to find a way to sneak in like Luke and them did in the movies with an old passcode or something. But chances are slim so I'd give this one a 7/10 depending on whether they can sneak on or get some old passcodes. R3: Unfortunately Vader and Palpatine don't make much of a difference in this round I think. MC and Doom Slayer still have the element of surprise, they aren't actively going to the place where Vader and Palps are going to be, and if Chief knows they are going to be onboard he will just have Doom Slayer cause some havok to draw their attention while he sneaks to the control room and plants the bomb. I don't think either MC or Slayer could solo Vader for very long even as a distraction, it all depends on whether Vader is able to sense them with the force and hunt them down personally I don't think he could since neither MC or Slayer are from the SW universe and therefore wouldn't have any force connection. 9/10 here depending on whether Vader just happens to be in the control room force choking some guy that pissed him off when Chief gets there. Bonus Round: Honestly this is most likely a win for SW in most cases. If the death star is on max alert from the start then MC and the Slayer are going to have a hell of a time getting on the death star in the first place. If they manage it then it would all come down to whether Vader and Palps are waiting in the control room or if they will try to search them out/be there when they land. If they get into a fight with one of the force users I think they might have a chance, but if the force users stay together then it will be extremely hard for MC and Slayer to win. All in all, the absolute best case scenario would be: they get on the death star with some kind of stealth ship despite it being on high alert, Vader immediately hunts them down while Palps sits back in the throne room thinking Vader can handle it. If they got into a 2 on 1 fight with Vader I honestly think they have an alright chance of winning just based on the fact that this is movie vader we are talking about so he doesn't have much in the way of reaction time or speed. Also his armor will probably make Chief's bullets a non factor, but the same goes for Chief's shielding against a lightsaber at least for one or two grazing hits, the Doom Slayer definitely has the guns to take Vader out though. People think Vader can just deflect his shots with lightsaber, but the Slayer's got his entire arsenal including the BFG, and movie Vader isn't deflecting that. Also movie Vader has never been shown to force choke 2 people at once IIRC, so MC can distract while Doom Slayer prepares for a kill. After that it all comes down to whether they can get to the control room before Palps senses what happened to Vader and gets there first. The infiltrators definitely have speed on their side but they still have hordes of minions to get through so they will probably have to fight Palps when they get there. The problem is, Palps most likely can't deflect the hailstorm of bullets and plasma that will be headed his direction, and even for him force lightning can only do so much against two very fast/strong/experienced fighters, especially when MC's armor can most likely stand up to force lightning long enough for the Slayer to get the kill. But keep in mind that this is all the best case scenario for MC and Slayer. If the force users team up or if they don't have a stealth craft that is good enough to get them onto the death star in the first place then it is going to be a hard loss. I'll give it to MC and Doom Slayer 1/10 just because we have seen similar intrusions into the death star with less powerful/experienced fighters and it is completely in Palps character to send Vader to the front lines before getting involved himself. TL:DR R1: 10/10 win for MC/Slayer R2: 7/10 win for MC/Slayer R3: 9/10 win for MC/Slayer Bonus: 1/10 win for MC/Slayer"

Any war, such as WW, Vietnam, Civil War, ancient wars, or any hypothetical real life war 1. Based on gameplay feats 2. Based on lore/canon feats There are 70+ characters to choose from so I don't think 5 both ways is to much to ask. Edit: ok with what I'm asking you'd potentially end up sharing 20 characters. You don't have to do 5 for each category/round I'd like you to though and if you want, go ahead. I'd just like to see a few more than 1 for each category/round.","Are they in-character? Snake and the Fire Emblem characters, while they lack the amazing powers of some of the others, are obvious choices because they have actual battlefield experience, making them able to contribute effectively. Someone like Kirby may be amazing on paper but if he's in character is also going to be difficult to deploy in a meaningful sense. Especially if we're going with Smash versions meaning they're all scaled to the same size and power level, Snake or one of the Fire Emblem characters is the obvious choice. The next question is what feats we're counting. Are these the Smash versions, or the ones from their base games? Is Ridley a giant dragon, or roughly the same size as a human? Is Rosalina able to create galaxies? Some of these characters especially Rosalina have feats from their home series that would put them completely beyond the scope of any human war."

"argumenta sobre: Is there any character who could make superman lose his faith in humanity? Title is self explanatory, everyone tries to make superman lose his hope and faith in humanity, can anyone actually accomplish this? We're talking about regular earth 1 superman, no alternate version who's evil or hopeless or depressed or whatever. They need to make the real and main version of the man of tomorrow lose his hope fair and square. Is this possible?","If Superman is unaware about the Apocalypse According to St John, then the Anti-Christ could convince the vast majority of the population to sin, and persecute all who resist. Idek if Superman can be converted to either side due to being extraterrestrial, so he'd just see 99% of people killing seemingly random blokes, and be unable to stop it due to the events being foretold by God. His faith in humanity would be restored after the end times, if he lives to see it, but the prompt doesn't demand his faith be lost longer than a single moment, which is all he needs."
"argumenta sobre: You are The Deadlifter. Any time you deadlift something, all of the dead in a 5 mile radius will 'lift' from their graves, get MASSIVE GAINS, and fight for you. Who is the strongest character you can defeat? The rules of you powers are as follows: - 'Lift' AOE is 5 miles. - Doesn't matter what you lift, so long as you deadlift it. - The amount of MASSIVE GAINS is relative to how much you lift. The dead will gain 25% of what you lifted in muscle, as well as a 10% increase in their height prior to last lift. - This affect stacks. Dead that is already lifted will gain more muscle and height if you deadlift again. However, this only works if the amount deadlifted is at least 25 pounds more than what is was upon the previous 'lift'. Better stretch bro! - Upon initial lifting, lifted dead are restored to 'living' condition eg they are not in a rotting, zombie-like condition. - Animals are 'lifted' too, but not insects. - Dead will remain lifted until killed again, or lifter dies. Dead lifted cannot be lifted again. - Dead being lifted must be moderately well preserved for lifting to occur",">The dead will gain 25% of what you lifted in muscle, as well as a 10% increase in their height prior to last lift. I'm having trouble parsing this out, so I'll lay out some assumptions: ""25% of what you lifted in muscle"" -> the dead gain muscle mass equivalent to 25% of what I dead lifted. ""10% increase in their height prior to last lift"" -> they grow by 10% of their living-height once lifted. These effects stack, but you can only add to the stack by pulling 25% more than your previous pull. The obvious strategy here is to go to the nearest big cemetery mine houses 200,000 former people and lift small, then build up. We'll say the people in the cemetery are 50/50 average men and women -- 100,000 men of 5'10"", 195 pounds, and 100,000 women of 5'4"" and 160 pounds numbers I got from googling. I will pull 45 pounds on my first rep, which will raise 200,000 undead soldiers from the earth and add 9 pounds of muscle to their frames. The men are now 6'6""/205, the women are 5'10, 170. Rinse and repeat, adding 25% each time, until I hit my 1RM of 315 lbs: Weight Lifted | Men | Women :--|:--|:-- 57 lbs|7'2""/219|6'5""/184 70 lbs|94""/236|84.7""/202 87.5lbs|103""/257|93""/224 110lbs|113""/284|102""/251 137.5lbs|124""/318|112""/285.375 175lbs|136""/361|123""/328 220lbs|149""/416|135""/383 315lbs|164""/494|148""/461 So at the end, I have a huge army of 200,000 very skinny, very tall monsters, with the men being 13 feet tall and 500 pounds, and the women 12 feet tall and 460 pounds. That's a big number of scary people. I think I could take on the real world and win, given those powers and a good strategy -- especially if it's possible to kill and raise someone in a powerful position, like the leader of a world power which should be possible, I think, given the ""restored to living condition"" part."
"argumenta sobre: 100 King Kong-sized humans vs 1 King Kong In the original ""100 humans vs an average gorilla"" debate, the consensus was that 100 humans are far too many for the average gorilla to come out alive, but the King is no average gorilla. The King is equipped with the Beast Glove, and is told to kill the 100 people that will have grown to his sized, with his species killed were he to fail. The fight takes place in New York City, and the humans are all random New York citizens that had suddenly grown, so no prep. R1: The humans are to fight barehanded, and are prohibited to throw or climb on buildings to lesses as much casualties as possible, but the GOAT doesn't give a shit, and the GOAT can still use whatever it takes to survive. R2: All bets are off, and the humans are free to do anything they want to kill the monkey. R3: There are now 3 Kongs. R4: Instead of King Kong, Godzilla is now the enemy. King Kong is also working with the humans in this one.","R1 and 2 are easy human victories. R3 is harder but still likely a decently easy victory. R4, most likely goes to the humans simply because numbers do matter a lot. And Kong prob has the axe I assume. Now of course if this was thermoor evolved thermo then easy Godzilla victory, but this is normalor evolved Godzilla. So, yea."

"argumenta sobre: Can we breed a 10 foot tall human in the next 50 years? Humanity devotes all of its resources to this project. Selective breeding, dangerous doses of HGH, pretty much anything is on the table. But the subject must actually grow to this height - they can't have their legs surgically lengthened or have a 3 foot horn implanted on their head.","I don't think so, we are too limited by the gene pool. The tallest living man is around 8 ft, the tallest living woman is 7 ft. It'll take around 25 years for their mutant kid to reach his full height so there will barely be enough time to try with a second generation. He'll already have abnormal levels of HGH so even with supplementation I doubt he gets much taller than 9'. I don't think CRISPR tech is advanced enough to edit him beyond those limits, at least not in 50 years."
